<b><u>Chapter 7: The Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>

The last chapter discussed the public sphere of the market where the capitalist purchases labour power as a commodity with the intent of augmenting the value of the materials he owns. This chapter describes the process by which this is achieved - the creation of surplus value.

Two sections.
The first describes the labour process - a tangible, physical transformation of natural raw material from dirt to product by the application of physical human effort - to create use values.
The second describes how the capitalist uses this process to create surplus value despite not physically participating in the above process.

Section 1: The labour-process or the production of use-values
1. Labour is a process, in which man and nature participate. Man appropriates nature using his own forces and transforms it, develops it in ways that suit his needs and wants. By working on soil to make it yield fruit, by herding and controlling cattle to aid in the process, and altering raw material to create products for consumption or tools and implements that allow for further development and sophistication of the means of production.

2. The labour process is an everlasting condition imposed on man by nature- ergo independent and common to every such social phase of history/existence.

3. Under the control of the capitalist, the labour process exhibits two properties:
3a. the labourer works under the capitalist's control whose ensures there is no needless waste of raw material, or unnecessary depreciation of the implements he owns.
3b. the final product is the property of the capitalist and not the labourer who is that product's immediate producer. The product of this process belongs, therefore, to him, just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar.

"The elementary factors of the labour-process are 1, the personal activity of man, i.e., work itself, 2, the subject of that work, and 3, its instruments."

Section 2:
Arriving at the conclusion that the final product made by the application of labour on raw materials does not have value that exceeds the sum of the values of the labor and raw materials congealed into it. Then describes how the capitalist gets around this. By using labour for longer than the bare minimum time required for the labourer to produce the amount of value required for self subsistence.

The crux of the argument is given by example:
* A laborer can spin 10 units of cotton into 10 units of yarn in 6 hours of labor - the combined cost of which is say 15 shillings (12 shillings for 10-cotton and 3 shillings for 6 hours of labour).
* The product; 10 units of yarn therefore is valued at 15 shillings which the capitalist has dispensed
* However, the laborer is given 20 units of cotton and made to work for 12 hours for the same amount of compensation as for 6 hours of labour- producing 30 shillings worth of yarn (12+12+6) for which the capitalist paid 27 (12+12+3) shillings. The added 3 shillings, surplus value, were congealed in the yarn though the additional 6 hours of work the labourer put in.

<u><b>Notable excerpts and remarks</b></u>
<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  1. <i>""In the process we are now considering it is of extreme importance, that no more time be consumed in the work of transforming the cotton into yarn than is necessary under the given social conditions. If under normal, i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour, then a day’s labour does not count as 12 hours’ labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12 b pounds of yarn; for in the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts. "</i></p>

This is a strange linguistic ontology of value. That value is determined by 'socially necessary labour time under normal, average conditions' which is broad and vague enough to not be instructive on exactly how to determine it. Value is taken as a property of what is produced that remains the same everywhere and is revealed by an esoteric calculation possibly by some vague linguistic construction and has specialized exceptions in which case it stops working. The usefulness of measurement lies in its capacity for simplicity and consistency - something that LTV seems to entirely fail at. Will a product made somewhat inefficiently have /no/ value? will it have lesser value? How is the objective value of products made in abnormal conditions measured? How can 'socially necessary' possibly be quantified and held as a common standard across time and space?

<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  2. <i>"The value of a day’s labour-power amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a day’s labour is embodied in that quantity of labour-power, i.e., because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour-power, cost half a day’s labour. But the past labour that is embodied in the labour-power, and the living labour that it can call into action; the daily cost of maintaining it, and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things. The former determines the exchange-value of the labour-power, the latter is its use-value. The fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day. Therefore, the value of labour-power, and the value which that labour-power creates in the labour-process, are two entirely different magnitudes; and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist had in view, when he was purchasing the labour-power. The useful qualities that labour-power possesses, and by virtue of which it makes yarn or boots, were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non; for in order to create value, labour must be expended in a useful manner. What really influenced him was the specific use-value which this commodity possesses of being a source not only of value, but of more value than it has itself. This is the special service that the capitalist expects from labour-power, and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the “eternal laws” of the exchange of commodities. The seller of labour-power, like the seller of any other commodity, realises its exchange-value, and parts with its use-value. He cannot take the one without giving the other. The use-value of labour-power, or in other words, labour, belongs just as little to its seller, as the use-value of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it. The owner of the money has paid the value of a day’s labour-power; his, therefore, is the use of it for a day; a day’s labour belongs to him. The circumstance, that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labour-power costs only half a day’s labour, while on the other hand the very same labour-power can work during a whole day, that consequently the value which its use during one day creates, is double what he pays for that use, this circumstance is, without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means an injury to the seller.

    Our capitalist foresaw this state of things, and that was the cause of his laughter. The labourer therefore finds, in the workshop, the means of production necessary for working, not only during six, but during twelve hours."</i></p>
So surplus value is a function of labour power having the capacity to produce more value by working the entire day despite requiring only half the amount of time to reproduce itself? Labour is a special commodity which is a source of vmore value than it has itself? If this is the correct interpretation then it seems to be the final death trap for this economic theory because marx here seems to have described an equivalent of perpetual motion machine that produces value from nothingness. A more convenient explanation for the creation of surplus value might be that the laborer is not adequately compensated for the expenditure of labour power - but adequacy is determined socially and contractually, not objectively. The notion of the laborer arriving at the workship to be surprised by terms of work involving additional hours also seems wrong considering that the worker usually has some approximate idea of the effort required before contractually agreeing to a price (which is the mutually agreed value for his labour).
