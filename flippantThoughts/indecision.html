   Sanko was currently standing outside the vaccination camp, deciding
   whether he ought to go in.

   Sanko had spent the previous week consumed in frustrating and
   laborious efforts to discover and read the official papers
   associated with each vaccine's trial data. It's not that he didn't
   believe that "vaccines worked" as different news anchors
   hoarsely repeated over and over again on TV, hoping to address the
   superstitions of a predominantly religious  population. Sanko was
   simply pessimistic to a degree that compelled him to account for
   all the niche exceptions that are conveniently glossed over as
   statistical collateral in the management of giant populations. If a
   vaccine was announced to have a 1 in million chance for producing a
   rare venous thromboembolism that would leave the vaccinated person
   crippled or dead, Sanko found little consolation in the assurance
   that it was statistically still the better strategy for the
   population. Moreover, given Sanko's history with ailments he had
   grown a more than serious reverence for the improbable in
   pathology. Statistical reassurances don't quite work for those
   who've found themselves in the collateral fold. The same way that
   improving car safety statistics don't offer any reprieve from grief
   to anyone crippled in a car accident.

   Sanko had deliberated over which vaccine to get for a week
   now. Vaccine-A carried a one in a million risk for him being
   riddled with a rare blood clot disorder. There was Vaccine-B that
   was better but it was available for his age group exactly at one
   center somewhere outside his city for which he had been unable to
   book an appointment slot. However, Vaccine-B was produced locally
   only in his own country and sanko wasn't sure if he would have
   access to it when he emigrated next year to a different place which
   might not distribute vaccine-B. Sanko could go for some other
   vaccine next year but there was no unambiguous clarification if one
   could switch vaccines over the years or if one remained locked in
   to the kind that they'd first taken. However, Sanko's vague
   intuitions about how antibodies work led him to believe that it was
   more likely that one /could/ change vaccines on a yearly basis. But
   once Sanko assured himself that Vaccine-B was ideal, there still
   remained other problems: first, that it was just not being offered
   to people in his age group and second, vaccine-B was studied only
   in fully healthy adults and subequent results weren't disclosed
   entirely transparently. 

   There was also Vaccine-C, large batches of which had been imported
   from a different country a month ago but for some reason had not
   yet entered into distribution. Sanko was both confused about
   why they weren't being administered and also certain that it surely
   must have to do with the colossal byzantine bureaucratic
   incompetence of the state machinery. A lifetime of living in his
   country had primed his intuitions to scream at him that those
   vaccines were likely stuck in some warehouse in temperatures that
   are decidedly contributing to their spoilage while the
   administrative body formulates a half reasonable policy that
   determines whre they ought to go. There were about a thousand news
   articles that parroted the same ambiguous announcement, copied
   verbatim from some unknown original source: "New vaccine arrives,
   roll out may begin next week, offering a ray of hope!". After
   reading the 67th "news" article that described in its main body
   absolutely no more information than the reader might glean from
   this title, Sanko learned that he couldn't possibly make a
   reasonable decision that accounted for Vaccine-C's future arrival.

   Sanko confronted Vaccine A and B again. Vaccine-A was immediately
   available but required a three month interval between doses, which
   meant postponing immunity for a considerable period of
   time. Vaccine B, the state government announced, would be available
   depending on which state the central government felt like being
   charitable towards on any particular day. Moreover, vaccine B might
   not necessarily be available to him due to his age. Another caveat
   to this was that vaccine B was, in fact, being offered to people at
   certain locations, but the criterion of its distribution was
   unclear. Vaccine B had a lower interval period between doses which
   promised full immunity much sooner but in order to wait for its
   arrival, Sanko would have to gamble on not contracting the disease
   before he got his first innoculation which remained at some
   indeterminate time in the future. Then there were other questions
   he had about how effective all of these vaccines were against each
   new variant, and was theoretically more likely to be against future
   variants - questions which he could not answer himself due to an
   insufficient understanding of immunology.

   Sanko had thought about all these factors. And on hearing news
   about how vaccines in his state were going to run out of soon as a
   violently virulent virus tore through his city, he decided to get
   vaccine-A, simply because it was available immediately.


   But as sanko stood outside the vaccination camp, he confronted over
   600 people in a densely packed space ahead of him. He stood in
   disbelief and wondered if it would be totally insane for him to
   calculate his odds of getting infected by the virus at the
   vaccination camp and compare those to his odds of getting infected
   by the virus waiting at home for a less insane vaccination
   strategy. He wondered if in this risk assessment he could also
   incorporate the 1 in a million chance of dying of thrombosis in
   case he /did/ survive the crowded vaccine camp fair.  

   As he stood outside looking at the camp, people his own age
   thronged together in groups standing close by exhibiting complete
   equanimity. An attendant with a megaphone announced that everyone
   was expected to follow social distancing rules (since the city was
   still in the middle of a devastating wave that had left a good
   chunk of the population with a dead loved one). This announcement,
   made every few minutes, eventually changed into impassioned
   requests and then finally into pathos ridden begging as the
   attendant pleaded continuously into the megaphone about the
   importance of maintaining queues and distance while everyone around
   him stood around treating his voice as general background static
   noise and violated all protocols put in place with some sort of
   casual unthinking calm that stunned Sanko.


   As more people walked by sanko and aggregated in densely packed
   clusters in the camp, he couldn't help but look at the whole affair
   in a dazed and bewildered state. He looked at them and tried to
   describe them to himself. Beautiful, confident people arriving in
   fashionable clothes and SUVs, with an air of self assurance in
   their actions that was totally alien to Sanko. He might even have
   admired them on any other day, at any other place. In school,
   college, work, on the street. But here he could only think about
   the the gulf that separated his response to this situation from
   theirs.


   What makes someone this confident? What is confidence? Is it
   one's propensity to meet the unknown without fear? If so, does it
   matter if one is powerful enough to meet the unknown without being
   annihilated or if one is simply deluded enough to believe that they
   can? 

   In the complicated calculus of risks involving serious contagious
   illnesses under uncertain circumstances and incomplete, ambiguous
   and misleading information permeating institutions that one does
   not trust, how does one make decisions confidently? Can one make
   decisions confidently? 

   Sanko realized he could not. He could simply hedge his bets based
   on whatever intuitions he could refine from information in which he
   put varying degrees of trust. And acutely conscious of the myriad
   ways in which his decisions could be later revealed to be
   regrettable or suboptimal, Sanko found his psyche tearing itself
   into pieces under the attempt to avoid the possibility of future
   regrets tearing him to pieces.

   But the people who waltzed into the camp were doing something
   qualitiatively different. Whatever it was, it allowed them some
   equanimity and beauty in demeanor that was so passionately coveted
   by Sanko that he had spent countless hours in his life, in school,
   in college and at work observing people just so that he could get
   at their secret. He had to know because it would save Sanko from
   the terrors of confronting the consequences of his decisions. And
   it would permit his appearance as a human among other humans. He
   would then finally walk, not as the anxious, uncertain, shy,
   recluse as he was often described to be, but as an outspoken,
   grand, boisterous, confident social creature. His inquiry into this
   had failed repeatedly - mostly by virtue of the beautiful and
   confident around him not having the patience to describe exactly
   how they dealt with questions that haunted Sanko. And often because
   their answers lay within the realm of some sort of magical thinking
   that escaped Sanko. The kind of magical thinking that seemed to
   inspire belief that they would be immune to a pathogen by virtue of
   just having a mask around their neck, irrespective of how properly
   it might be worn. Or that aggregating in tight groups was perfectly
   safe if it was 'outdoors'. Sanko wasn't exempt from this and he
   surely harbored bizarre, irrational and distorted forms of thinking
   too. But the differences between his magic and everyone else's
   seemed significant enough on days like this - when he remained
   paralyzed into inaction and terror amid others who moved with
   conviction and calm.



   Sanko stood outside the camp. He looked above at the cloudy sky and
   took a minute to find some calm through it. Maybe averting his gaze
   to something uncomplicated and simple would untangle his mind.

   As he stood there he remembered his college days, when he largely
   remained a social recluse, refusing to become visible to people
   around him and going to great lengths to be undiscoverable to his
   peers from his past. He had not secured admission into the most
   prestigious universities after school and he conceptualized this
   failing in a manner that also made it either impossible for him to
   be admitted into the company of men and women for whom this was an
   important value. Every one of his peers at that age had spent two
   grueling years measuring their days by their distance from the
   fulfillment of this ultimate goal - securing a prestigious future
   through a prestigious university. Sanko, having faltered in this
   effort, had decided to excuse himself from the scrutiny of everyone
   he knew in order to escape becoming fixed as a certain figure of
   defeat under their gaze. He began to spend more time withdrawn unto
   himself in his room, avoiding contact with anyone from his past and
   almost everyone around him in the present.

   He was convinced that this exile would end on some glorious day
   when he could conclusively demonstrate his brilliant achievement of
   values held in common by those around him. Values that celebrate
   life, bring joy, precipitate admiration, bestow beauty and induce
   love. He would arrive at a fantastical point of brilliance that
   would end his alienation once and for all and he would then live
   out the rest of his life in the comfortable cyclical repitition of
   days comprising of minor trifles incapable of disrupting the
   immutable flow of his actions willed by an undercurrent of
   contentment and its preservation. 


  For now, the thought of confronting said failure or people who
  reminded him of it began to give rise to a whole host of feelings
  that were viscerally unpleasant but which he didn't recognize as
  significant since he always had the alternative of escaping them by
  further withdrawing into the tiny provincial coccoon of cyclical
  days spent behind the screen addressing coursework. He judged his
  own existence by the metrics he assumed were held universally among
  his peer group by which he wasn't doing spectacular. Was this shame?


  Really what seemed to him to be the most consistent progenitor of
  failures had been the structure of his responses to similar failures
  in the past. Said structure is schematically not too distict from
  that of the constant regret of having lost out on an alternative
  version of himself that didn't make the mistakes that he did and
  fail where he did. Of the rewards and comparitive richness of life
  that seems to be constantly elusive. Even now as he vaguely
  remembered how grand and beautiful his aspirations were of himself
  at some point and how they've only diminished with time. He doesn't
  mean to be self pitying. But he wanted to describe clearly the
  source of his own judgment of himself and also the differences that
  make him anxious about the trajectory of his life and making it
  visible to someone who is privy to it.  

  He often looks at people on the internet as a voyeur - people who he
  knows in real life but has rarely ever talked to. They often post
  photographs of luxurious consumptions - of food and travel. And many
  seem to just post pictures of themselves in pretty clothes. Some
  brag about their careers but most just share pictures of them with
  their friends which attracts some generic discussion or symbolic
  approval. The content itself isn't as interesting to Sanko as the
  fact that all these people are very comfortable with publicly
  engaging in rituals that he personally would be terrified to
  try. People posting pictures of themselves with their dog in their
  homes and getting validated for it. In that social act there isn't
  any discussion of whether they went to a prestigious university or
  not. what their careers are. something very simple is happening here
  relative to the complex pessimistic theater that exist in Sanko's
  head. they simply don't take things very seriously. few of them care
  about having been admitted to a prestigious university by now. few
  seem to be particularly bothered about their larger career
  trajectory - at least not visibly so. in this social transaction
  people casually surf the social scene through generic compliments,
  casual affirmation and simple pictures of themselves with the
  occasional attempt at showing off their photographs.   

  So why can't Sanko do this too? He suspected because maybe there
  were some ideas he harbored of himself in relation to others that
  remain perpetually unfulfilled - deferring his arrival into the
  world to another day.  Sanko lived in fear that he might meet the
  world before he was ready, before he had done justice to the values
  he felt were important. before he'd succeeded and become beautiful
  and grand.

  Sanko now suspected it wouldn't happen unless he pared what he
  project himself to be. Acquiesed to the the facts of his life, and
  started out once again with minimal and simpler expectations. of
  expanding his speech and presence in the lives of those around him
  slowly and with lesser pressure. of taking the process of his
  participation with the world, less seriously. 


   He considered asking for advice but decided against being a nuisance
   to anyone else. It occurred to him that he could simply do the most
   obvious thing - walk in, get the vaccine and do what everyone
   else was doing. It also occurred to him that the confidence
   exhibited by those around him might just stem from a tacit
   acceptance of the risks and consequences and willingness to bear
   them without tormenting the self with remorse or regret. Sanko only
   needed to acquiesce to certain external risks beyond his control
   and willingly decide not to attribute blame/guilt/regret at himself
   in the future in order to become capable of deciding and then
   acting in the present. If his decision led to his devastation, he
   would have to find solace in remembrance of this pact he is making
   to himself and be consequently forgiving. After briefly rethinking
   all the risks again, he decided to head back home, determined to
   soon get vaccinated at some other less crowded space. He believed
   more in his ability to isolate himself from the dangers of the
   crowd in his own room far more than he believed in the crowd's
   capacity for consideration for him in the public realm.


   A day later, the government announced that the country had run out
   of vaccines and would resume innoculations "soon" without giving a
   clear date.  

   Two days later, sanko began to exhibit troubling symptoms which
   indicated he had contracted the virus. 

   Two weeks later, Sanko reflected on how he ended up on his
   deathbed and correctly surmised that he might have contracted the
   virus from someone walking past him as he contemplated going into
   the vaccination camp outside.
  
   He guessed that a good fraction of the 600 people at the camp must
   have gotten infected too. However there was absolutely no record or
   statistic to document this fact. There were instead several public
   discussions about the bravado and wisdom of people who got
   vaccinated early. These people would go on to speak of their astute
   and sharp assessment of the situation that helped them
   survive. Those who didn't survive, couldn't possibly add nuance to
   that view. 

   Anyway, it didn't matter now. The last words sanko heard were his
   parents informing his other loved ones that he had deliberately
   decided against getting vaccinated for some inexplicable reason.
