   yuki is laying on his back. he doesn't know what time it
   is. he vaguely suspects might need to eventually, but is shirking
   finding out for now. 

   He lives in a square room which contain all his material
   possessions - stationery, furniture, books, linen, clothes that
   currently surround the mat on which he is resting and looking at
   the ceiling fan with a blank gaze. 

   yuki is thinking about nothing in particular and deliberately
   so. he woke up a few minutes ago and knows that it won't be long
   before the usual patterns of his thought come together to compel
   him into some form of action with the pretence of some productive
   use. for now, he's watching how the yellow lamp illumindates the
   fan on his ceiling and dispassionately observing the the
   imperceptible shifts in shade across its blades. 

   He looks out the window and sees an ambulance stand below a
   streetlight illuminating a group of flies swirling around each
   other just below its yellow bulb. He cannot see the moon and
   guesses that it's likely hidden by the five storied behemoth of a
   building that came up last year and has since then blocked any
   sunlight from entering his room. Yuki doesn't particularly care
   anymore. He looks at the tiny patch of sky still visible through
   his windows and cannot spot a single star with his naked eye. He
   briefly considers getting his glasses but decides against it
   because he has no hope that tonight's sky would be any less
   polluted to make that effort worthwhile. His vision is poor without
   his glasses and the doctor has asked him to wear them all the time,
   but yuki isn't particularly sure if he wants to look at anything
   more keenly than he has already. 

   He looks around his room. Familiar objects that can't speak, or
   look at him. A chair. A blanket. A desk. Curtains. Books. A
   computer that's switched off. It occurred to Yuki that he ought to
   respond to the emails he has been getting from recruiters
   requesting interviews. But he squeamishly pushes that thought aside
   and instead returns his attention to the more inert objects around
   him. They bore him terribly, but he has begun to prefer this
   listless ennui recently.   

   Yuki hears the a cricket chirping outside his window and allows
   himself to listen to the counters of its sound and follow it as
   long as he can. The predictible raspy repetititions make for an
   excellent lullaby and yuki is hoping to fall asleep again despite
   having woken up recently.  

   He begins to feel hungry and is reminded of a geographically
   distant friend from a different  timezone who might be awake at
   that hour. Yuki begins to wonder what they might haved cooked for
   the day. He considers a call and quickly practices how he might
   articulate the question without sounding morose.





   Between any two people there are a certain set of facts that become
   visible. First through their articulation by one through speech or
   demonstration. And then through the intercourse of ideas and
   perspectives that surround those facts with structures of
   understanding and possible forms of action that can permit one to
   thrive. Some facts are granted lesser importance or seriousness and
   some more so. Some yield a rich flourishing of ideas while others
   result in desultory silences and awkward attempts of
   evasion. Yuki's own life consisted of a set of facts that affected
   him in myriad ways. He harbored vague intuitions about how to
   conceptualize them and decide his actions in response to them but
   most of those vague intuitions came from the common wisdom of elders
   who he considered to be impeccable models of unhappiness and
   frustration. His distrust of such common wisdom often drove him to
   seek an explicit, clear and direct understanding of the
   platonically ideal ways that might help him evade what he saw to be
   etched very obviously in the faces of people older than him:
   resignation. 

   Yuki could of course speak to people his own age.

   Yuki checks his messages and considers responding to a close friend
   who is expecting a reply. Yuki looks at his email and
   finds several emails by recruiters from socially prestigious
   corporations inviting him for a job interview. Yuki presses his ear
   against the door and can hear the faint voice of his neighbor
   fighting with their spouse. Yuki looks at a newspaper kept near his
   desk and finds the usual macabre spectacle of death, disease,
   remarks on a callous and violent ruling body of people and
   indignant leftists screaming hoarsely about the injustices
   entailed. 


   He vaguely remembers when he desperately yearned for intimacy and
   assimilation among people he admired and within whom he intended to
   embed himself. When he sought prestigious employment with a fat
   paycheck. A theory of the world and its political history that
   would grant him total understanding of the context of his life. A
   communion with neighbors and an inevitable brilliant arrival into
   the social sphere unmarred by self doubt and insecurity. He
   remained convinced that a point of contentment existed somewhere
   that lay at the nexus of the total satisfaction of these wants. But
   instead yuki arrives at a point of apathetic disillusionment. Yuki
   discovers paid employment to be the surest way to kill his spirit
   and will to perform labor. Believing that responding to his
   recruiters will inevitably land him a 10hr/day job producing
   products for which he harbors unfathomable ideological contempt and
   which pays him a colossal amount to settle down in a distant
   sterile suburb among other immigrants who revel in weekend trips to
   the bar and 3 day tourist getaways at exotic places with the
   express intent of acquiring an exquisite photograph that nobody
   will look at.

   He finds social theory to be the surest way to find oneself trapped
   in a literature of moralisms masquerading as objective
   science. Utopian hopes to convince the jaded that there exists some
   objective set of laws in the world of men and women that will lead
   to an ultimate point of egalitarian peace unperturbed by
   heterogenous distribution of power and resources. Massive cults of
   righteous students who believe their superficial attempts at
   activism on internet platforms somehow constitute a meaningful
   'resistance' against a system they have neatly incorporated
   themselves into. Resistence, apparently is not futile. According to
   Yuki it serves as an excellent source of righteous self worth to
   signal a set of morally superior values involving faux displays of
   verbal compassion and want for justice from within bourgeois
   homes. Yuki had delved into theory and considered doing the same
   with praxis but found the former to be bunk and the latter to be
   worse. 

   He finds that his neighbors exist in a web of daily frustrations
   with which he cannot empathize. 

   Lastly the people who he can vaguely describe as his friends exist
   in a constellation of online relationships sustained by verbal
   amusements and fleeting comforts that never quite address deeper,
   more profound hurts and dissatisfactions, either yuki's or their
   own. There was a time when he didn't have access to even this. When
   he existed in an empty vacuum of abject loneliness and social
   deprivation where his fears of being an awkward imposition would
   paralyze him before he could make any meaningful attempt at forging
   a healthy relationship. Over time, he had learned and crawled
   out of that state by learning how to speak but the indignities he
   perceived during that transformation made him extraordinarily
   cynical and convinced that he would never quite be granted
   admission into the public realm if he did not adhere to a very
   small set of affects which met the unspoken, narrow and indirectly
   observed criterion of pleasantness set by those around him. Maybe
   this is was part of a necessary socialization that everyone had to
   go through, but for Yuki it was particularly humiliating
   considering he always found himself instinctually at odds with what
   he thought he needed to do to assimilate among people even if to
   just find out that he at least could. 

   However, yuki thought that the discovery of some wisdom would
   justify this effort. He would learn how to survive and avoid misery
   by watching others succeed where he failed.  He could
   incorporate their ideas into his life and by doing so escape the
   provincial limitations of his own thought. He would mimic, learn
   and secretly imitate their actions until he was certain about
   having arrived at a point of complete understanding of how to be a
   human among others. He would avoid misery in his life by observing
   those who seemed more content than he was.

   But yuki was miserable anyway. With ruined political hopes and a
   ruinous set of illnesses and the general despondency of finding
   himself in a room with no capacity to summon any joy he might want
   to share with another, yuki just could not bring himself to speak
   to anyone. He had no faith that it would yield any fruit and no
   faith in the act of making known to others the set of facts that
   surrounded his life. All his plans, ideas and attempts at evading
   catastrophe by talking to anyone would lead him to catastrophe
   anyway. Planning, talking, distracting were all futile.


   Convinced that he would meet either dismissal, ridicule or empty
   condolences, he ultimately understood that there was perhaps more
   dignity in the quiet solemn acquiescence to this state of
   languishing. Instead of perpetuating despair and hopelessness to
   those he loved, yuki would keep to himself until his conditions
   improved, however long it took.


   But yuki was immensely pained by the possibility of those close to
   him interpreting his silence as apathy when in fact it was an
   intense desire to avoid subjecting them to the morbidity of his
   cycnicisms. He yearned to be in the joyous company of those for
   whom he felt affectionately. But the mere act of speaking which
   inevitably led to misrepresention causing anguish to himself and
   disappointment to the other was daunting enough to keep him from
   it. 

   Looking at the screen yuki just doesn't know what to say to
   anyone that he seriously considers as necessary or
   important. Everybody is embedded in their own peculiar trajectory
   and yuki can't possibly claim or see how he might contribute to it.

   He decides against responding to anyone after discovering that he
   has nothing to say that that really needs to be said. Maybe he
   could find something to say that could excite, tittilate, amuse or evoke
   joy. But that would be disingenuous of yuki and require him to pull
   off a colossal pretence of normalcy and pleasantness that he
   couldn't bring himself to indulge. 

   The set of facts that constitute their life seem to now be in
   complete disjunction with yuki's own. Nothing can be usefully
   said or understood. The chaotic depredations of an uncertain and
   chaotic life can only be resisted through quiet action perhaps. 

   Yuki considers explaining himself but isn't sure what that might
   achieve and if that would interest anyone. He wonders what his
   explanations, ideas, perspectives all amount to if they engender
   this much despair and cynicism. Probably not much. So he decides to
   not perpetuate any of them.


   Yuki is 26.


   Yuki wants to stop thinking this way. 


   Yuki considers writing to his close friend but isn't sure how to
   articulate his condition.


   Yuki decides to look at his unremarkable ceiling and find comfort
   in it for now.


   Before going to sleep he decides to go to his blog and apologize to
   anyone who still cares to read. 

   I'm sorry for my reticence. Speaking seems futile and normalcy
   seems evasive - the kind that seems to be a pre-requisite for
   social contact. I am searching for a set of beautiful facts that I
   can confidently assert but I have not found them yet. 

   After yuki wrote this, he understood that he had already
   misrepresented himself. And to avoid causing further confusion he
   decides to stop and go back to sleep.


   Maybe tomorrow he will try to find an excuse to talk to anyone. IF
   not, at least he will hope for the betterment of his own conditions
   until he discovers compelling reasons to speak.

   Or until he arrived at his moment of flourishing.
