<b>musings from an unpleasant day </b> 
<hr>

".. This is it. With perfect lucidity, I now grok the trajetory of my life and
its singular encapsulated meaning. Every memory of mine reveals itself as the
record of an event perfectly designed to brilliantly achieve the complex and
overarching plan of this life with one purpose: disintegration. One orchestrated
so completely that every single lived moment plays some role to aid it. It's so
obvious now. I can finally understand myself and bring an end to this
philosophical confusion about the metaphysical reasons for my being
alive. Nothing else explains everything that has occurred. Every aspiration I've
held has served to accentuate the bitterness felt at its unfulfillment. Every
word I've heard serves to exacerbate the very personal humiliation of absolute
failure. All ideas I've encountered, however contradictory among themselves, now
seem to arrive at a consensus on the invalidity of everything i have
thought. All social contact seemingly ordained to bring me to a point of an
alienation so sharp that every facet of my being seems deliberately inhuman,
continuously in the process of unbecoming what it was before until it
slowly disintegrates exposing a uniform current of horrified despair beneath it
which fades away into unobserved nothingness"

"Seems a bit excessive"

"Ah but it's not. You'll never understand. The kind of disasters I've confronted
seem cruel not just for their immediate material consequences but also in the
conceptual relevance to the narrative framework through which I look at my life
and systematize it into discrete events of greater or lesser importance,
meriting various degrees of attention, understanding, recording and responding
to. Yes, I've suffered an injury but it's painful not just for its visceral
effects but for everything it means in response to every action I've taken in my
life so far and how it is either nullified or turned into perverse by it. It's
marvelously humbling. Over two decades of careful, concerted construction of
adaptations that I had hoped would allow me to become a useful member of
society, undone so simply by one freak injury - rare and avoidable. Not just
undone, but turned into a testament of stupid hubris demonstrated by someone
oblivious to his own fragility. This will haunt me as long as I'm embedded in
society. The embedding itself possible due to a set of relations defined by
their decay, collapse, rot or hostility. All pulling and pushing and multiplying
the pain felt at the center of a trajectory of destruction: me"

"you sound like an insufferable drama queen"

"Ofcourse. That's the intent. To dramatize these horrors to make them palatable
and understandable to someone, anyone. The awful complexity with which I see the
efforts of my life nullified or made perverse is completely beyond you. With
every defeat I see the invalidation of a whole history of desires and efforts
that were defeated too. Moreover, the meta-textual and contextual implications
offer themselves to endless analysis and deconstruction of my being under this
newer development in what seems like a meticulously constructed personal hell."

"hell is biblical. you never were christian. historicize your ideas."

" maybe i ought to look towards god. the surgical precision with which the
events of my life have been ordained to induce anguish and misery must certainly
point if not to an entity with such designs then to some freak cosmic occurence
marked by the clinical construction of such a perfect tragedy. "

"sounds like creationism"

"but what if there is a sadistic agent responsible for it? what if it's me? What
if i possess the unique characteristics of a human whose every action and
thought inadvertently furthers him from his own wellbeing and towards his own
destruction. It would be unnoticeable for some time, and then amusing and
humorous, and then deeply disconcerting. And that's exactly how it has been."


"or maybe you're letting your tendency to be hyperbolic run away. i'll
come with you to the doctor."



"that's exactly what I don't want. if i have to choose between the
dignity of suffering in isolation and the humiliation of suffering in
the gaze of another, what do you think would be preferable? I don't
need help. Pains are ultimately borne alone. They cannot by
distributed in company, only multiplied. And I cannot further burden
my conscience by having a loved one bear the brunt of my misery and
get dragged into it - something which is inevitable around an ailing
person. So begone. Leave me be. Or let me run away into an invisible
space until I'm perfectly healthy, and have overcome all my
afflictions. Until then I am determined not to be a burdensome
nuisance on anyone else".


"Or maybe people around you aren't as bothered. Maybe they intend to
extend their help in little ways that make life convenient without any
promise of relieving your pain or taking any onto themselves. These
little things go a long way in keeping things from becoming
overwhelming as they evidently are right now. Providing reassurances
and comfort in moments of certainty. Preventing your anxieties from
flooding you and carrying you into bad decisions. Providing
perspectives in how to approach doctors and plan the recovery
better. These things aren't burdensome, but allow people around you to
feel good about contributing to someone and something important to them."


"Lies. For every act of support, a secret score is kept and the one
extending help becomes entitled to another pound of flesh in the near
future. The feeling of goodness that one gets from supporting another
comes from having put another in debt to oneself so that one can hold
expectations from them in time of future need or want. It's secretly
selfish, yet nobody admits it. Instead it's couched in an overly
sentimental mystified philosophy of love and care and support when
instead it is an opportunity for those around you to exploit
vulnerability for personal gain."

"Is that how you think when extending help to another?"

"No. I'm different. From everyone else."

"You surely must be joking."

"I'm not sure."

"It's late. Get some sleep instead of pointlessly
catastrophizing. You'll be fine."

And on hearing that Gulshan decided to conclude his day and go to bed,
with just one thought repeating itself to him:
