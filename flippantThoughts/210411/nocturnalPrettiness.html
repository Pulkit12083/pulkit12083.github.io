<b>delhi. midnight. mid pandemic. mid curfew </b> 

The cab was waiting for him half a kilometer away. The stretch from his place to
the cab littered with several packs of strays, all of whom extremely upset at the
presence of a lonesome figure on one end of the street. As they howled and
approached him, he stood straight, looking ahead, half prepared to get mauled. A
police SUV came by, which allowed him to ask the policement if he could hitch a
short ride through the street. "Considering how out of hand corona is getting
right now, we can't let anyone in" the policeman responded and drove away. 

So Gulshan moved ahead through all packs of strays who after howling at him for a
good part of the walk decided to harass a drunk man walking 50 feet behind him. 

Midway through this walk he saw a man standing with a stick, hired to keep an
eye on an expensive car right beside him. Gulshan asked him for company till the
end of the street. The man displeased about having to abandon the espensive car,
relented, walked a few feet with him and then left.

At the end of the street he turned a corner and saw an SUV with its lights
flashing at the end of the road. As he came closer, he noticed that it was
parked in the middle, the door was open and a man was sitting on the ground a
few feet away from the vehicle. Holding his knee. The extent of his 
inebriation became apparent as Gulshan walked past him, which prompted the man to
try to get up and then fail. He was in his 40s, wearing a checked T-shirt and
brown pants, nothing ostentatious. Bald. Big moustache. bloodshot eyes. entirely
incapable of driving in his current state.  Gulshan considered stopping to extend
help, but he was so singularly occupied with his current crisis that he couldn't
bring himself to care as he walked by.

1AM .

In the backseat of a cab hurtling towards a hospital at 60 miles per hour
through empty delhi roads drenched in streetlight yellow,  Gulshan leaned against
the left door and allowed the wind to hit his face as he looked out. 

This was a nice moment. He could only hear the sound of the wind and the car
speeding through a relatively quiet cityscape. He wouldn't mind if he didn't
reach the hospital anytime soon. Empty autos, shops with shutters down, metro
stations with locked gates, apartment buildings with lights turned off in every
room facing the road, desolate pavements with scraps of litter and the
occasional stray, neon boards inviting you to shut restaurants, all passing by
to the fuzzy sound of the wind singing in his ear as he reclined back, closed
his eyes and let some calm wash over him. In the liminal space between his home
and the hospital, where all decisions and responsibilities lay suspended, he
could maybe find some comfort - irrespective of whether he was in pain or
not. Some absolution from the demands of his life that might soon grow exacting
and on being unmet bring further defeat or sadness. He couldn't do much wrong at
that point. Nor could he feel guilty for whatever joy he felt hurtling through
such a pretty scape at 60 miles an hour.

2AM.

The driver arrived at the private hospital's emergency ward. Gulshan got off and
looked at the entrance from a distance. A security gard, an ambulance parked
near him, and some men pensively standing together outside the door - sombrely
noting any changes in scene around them, including his arrival, and then
returning to pensively looking at each other or the ground. They seemed
preoccupied, the way relatives of grievously ill people at hospitals generally
are. 


As Gulshan walked towards the glass door he looked inside and found it to be
sufficiently sparsely occupied. The board nearby that said it was a
"non-covid-related-emergency-ward" further inspired confidence. And so Gulshan
went in.

Sounds of a few monitors beeping loudly. Doctors pacing from one bed to
another. People lying motionless and quiet on their beds as their relatives
stood near them the same way the group of men outside the ward had - pensively
and quietly. A man holding his wife's hand as she looked at the ceiling while on
her bed - possibly under some medication and waiting for the next doctor to give
further intsructions. Two women sitting silently on a stretcher in the corridor,
leaning against each other. there is no boisterous talk. Every temporary visitor
there is usually quiet, sombre and likely developing an appreciation for bodily
fragility. The only people demonstrating any form of vitality seem to
be the young resident doctors in green scrubs, all wearing masks and acting on
all these listless bodies with a sense of urgency. Gulshan walked towards the
desk that seemed to very evidently exist for allocating the right patient to the
right doctor. Behind it, a man wearing an N-95 looked at him tensely and asked
him what he wanted. Gulshan explained that he was in pain, possibly due to an
injury and wanted to have it looked at.

"When did this happen"

"2 days ago"

"Then why are you here now?" the man in scrubs asked rhetorically, seemingly
irritated just by the sight of another idiot plaguing him and the ward at this
hour when there were seemingly other more seriously ill bodies to save. He
called someone on the landline phone and described why he was required to come
visit and asked Gulshan to wait in the corridor. He looked vacantly towards the
bed with the loudest monitor displaying all stats in yellow instead of the usual
green and with the most number of doctors around it. the person on it was
motionless and seemed to be in a fetal position. other doctors seemed occupied
with paperwork, calls or moving from one bed to another. there was something
oddly mesmerizing about this scene. Being surrounded by bodies more fucked than
his own seemed reassuring in its own disturbing way. The resident supposed to
look at Gulshan arrived and after conducting some checks declared that surgery
would be moot and the best thing for Gulshan to do would be to wait for the
results of the MRI until next day and then come back for a
consultation. Meanwhile, he could use any off-the-counter painkillers.

3 AM.

Gulshan walked out and noticed the impressive cylindrical building with several
glimmering lights illuminating its glass facade. He didn't want to go home just
yet. The wind was cool and pleasant. And it had been a while since he had been
somewhere new this late out at night. So he decided to loiter and walk around in
the hospital complex. A group of men playing cards on one of the lawns. A
security guard sleepily repeating "daro mat" (fear not) to seemingly noone;
presumably referring to the virus gripping the city. An empty parking lot with a
man and a woman in scrubs talking to each other beneath a light illuminating the
space. Electric generators humming. A white tent with plastic chairs and a metal
fan someone forgot to turn off beneath a misspelt sign that said "vaccinatons
here". A makeshift shed in white, brightly illuminated and with two doctors in
hazmat suits tending to people on white beds inside - likely the emergency covid
ward. a security guard standing outside that same shed, wearing an N-95 better
than anyone else at that hospital. Two men loitering outside the ward, waiting
for something, someone. A small temple shed in the corner decorated with
flickering multicolored string lights and a fluorescent tubelight inside
ensuring that the idols in there could be visible to anyone who might want to
pray to them in the middle of the night. At a hospital, such a thing might not
be too unlikely. Gulshan peered into the main building from outside and saw empty
lobbies with relatives of the ailing sleeping on metal chairs. Another lobby had
a TV playing to nobody in the room. As Gulshan walked further he could see through
the glass wall into offices of doctors who didn't bother to bring the blinds
down. Printers, desks, equipment, dimly illuminated from the ambient light
entering the rooms from corridors. It was quiet. The world was quiet. Everyone
was asleep. That comforted him. He kept walking and admired the dazzling array
of lights in the hospital complex which seemed to be brighter than any star in the
sky. A construction barricade with the sign "your safety is in /your/ hands"
greeted him. Gulshan walked ahead, reluctant to go home, but ultimately finding
himself at a big open gate leading out to a deserted road and an entirely static scene
except some trees swaying to the wind and a traffic light blinking in yellow at
a nearby intersection. He sat on the pavement a second time and looked around
him. Granite road. Concrete walls and pillars. Metal fences. An imposing metro
station. No sound but that of rustling leaves and some distant vehicle. Two
scooters with two people each turned around the corner and entered the
hospital. Gulshan couldn't discern which carried the person who needed a doctor
but found it amusing that scooters seemed to be acceptable forms of 
ferrying patients who needed critical care.

As he walked outside the complex along the fence, he arrived at the main gate of
the hospital - with a giant hoarding announcing the arrival of the vaccine that
would hopefully save them all. He sat next to the hoarding and looked at the
blinking traffic light which seemed to glow with a regular, non-chaotic
hypnotizing periodicity.

Every 20 minutes an ambulance would enter the hospital or leave for somewhere. 

A tired dog looked at him with suspicion for a minute and then seemingly went
back to sleep outside the main gate, seemingly content that he didn't need to be
barked at or threatened. Nearby another temple with hindu idols in it and a neon
light flickering outside it, some bank ATMs a few feet away from the temple. And
between the two, some people sleeping on the pavement and in rickshaw without
the kind of access to shelter that marble idols in that temple did. Money
and god were necessary near a hospital. Comfortable places to sleep apparently
weren't. Maybe some day it would be the other way round. 

In the distance a police SUV with flashing red/blue lights and two cops inside
listening to the radio.

He didn't want to go home. that would imply the resumption of his life and he felt
reluctant to partake in that trajectory. the pretty ordinariness of the city at
this hour seemed to enchant like few other things did.

He then booked the cab home anyway, fearing it  might become progressively harder
to get back as the night progressed. 

4 AM.

60 miles an hour towards his <a href="../../index.html">home</a> weren't as comforting as the 60 miles an our
away from it.
