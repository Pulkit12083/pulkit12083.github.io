<b>"you'll be fine". (but what if I'm not?) </b> 
<hr>

   "but what if I'm not?" is the thought to which Gulshan woke up the next day and
   the thought which compelled him to search for doctors in his area on the
   internet. It briefly occurred to him that this was still a relatively new
   development in history- access to a list of doctors across the city. His parents
   would have to rely on one or two doctors they knew personally and
   trusted. Gulshan could theoretically visit any doctor he wanted, although
   none seemed to inspire any particular trust in him.


   In the general subdued anxiety of arriving at a quick conclusion to the pain
   that was bothering him. Gulshan tried to find a suitable doctor closest to
   him. But with the vague intention of also optimizing on how competent the
   doctor might be, he also wanted to avoid visiting smaller clinics with
   relatively inexperienced staff. Unfortunately there was no way to discern any
   of this at the moment. So he just tried to find doctors that would be
   available for a consultation on that sunday at all. 

   There was one available 30 minutes away. Gulshan took an auto and arrived at a
   small dingy empty hospital in uttam nagar. On his way, he tried to get an
   idea of the risk he was incurring by visiting a hospital in the middle of the
   worst pandemic wave this city had seen since it began. 15% positivity
   rate. One out of every six people he saw on the street could have it.  

   The "hospital" was crammed between a sugarcane juice shop and an electronics
   store and was recognizable due to a bunch of blue boards that announced the
   hospital's name. There was only one small doorway that would lead inside to
   the receptionist's desk manned by a woman eating paan, who, despite working
   in a hospital, was wholly indifferent to the mask hanging from her ear. "hi,
   I'd like to meet Dr Anthony". The woman spit the paan out in a bin and
   revealed that he was at home but would arrive within 20 minutes. 

   Meanwhile, he would have to wait in the lobby which had a few seats next to
   the glass pane looking out into a busy street occupied with autos, fruit
   vendors, rickshaws, pedestrians and people going about their usual day
   indifferent to the hospital and all afflictions that separated life inside
   it from the life outside. Gulshan found something calming about looking at the
   dense, hectic animated streets churning noisily in the searing heat through
   the window of this empty hospital lobby which by contrast was quiet and
   cool. It also vaguely reminded him of his time in childhood spent in a
   pediatric clinic's lobby when he confronted more innocuous ailments and still
   harbored confidence in the existence of a pill for every medical problem, a
   cure for every disease, and the wisdom of his caretakers which couldn't
   possibly fail him. 
 
   Things were different now. He snapped out of the vacant mesmerized gaze with
   which he was looking outside and instead scanned the hospital
   lobby. Vaccination posters on the wall. A disused stretcher now serving as 
   lobby seating space. A tiny in-house pharmacy manned by nobody at the
   moment. Opposite the reception was a darker room with a guy wearing a white
   coat napping on a stretcher next to some old equipment. The receptionist
   idling behind the counter on her phone playing bejewelled. No other patient
   besides him. Oddly comforting. A listless unexciting scene is exactly what
   Gulshan needed as antidote to his latent anxieties. 

   He checked his phone. He'd received a message: "Where are you? I can
   help". He decided against having company. Partly because he did not want to
   give anyone the solace of having "helped" or the self satisfaction of having
   done their part by simply being present and extending some shallow emotional
   gestures of "support". Partly because he was superstitious and felt that the
   company of those dear to him would surely bring more ruin. Partly because he
   did not want to appear flailing and weak. But mostly because he wanted to
   take responsibility and avoid being a nuisance to another.

   He paid Rs 700.

   After a very anxious wait, the doctor arrived, did his checkup and declared
   that Gulshan had arrived too late, but concluded that it might not be of much
   consequence if he was lucky. A certain diagnosis would be possible only after
   an MRI. And getting the kind Gulshan needed, on a Sunday in the middle of a
   pandemic wave might be not be possible. Nevertheless, Gulshan could get some
   preliminary tests done at the hospital and wait a day or two for the MRI. 

   He paid Rs 500.

   Then he took an auto to an imaging lab in new rajinder nagar. It was 4PM.
   He arrived to a largely empty clinic with a receptionist who seemed to
   respect masks more than the previous one, as evidenced by her wearing it
   right below her nose, instead of the chin. Near the reception was an empty
   room with several rows of empty metal chairs arranged to look towards a small
   CRT monitor TV hanging on the wall currently running a 'news' channel
   reporting on an irrelevant local brawl in some other part of the city. 

   "Why do people get into physical fights?" Gulshan wondered. Bodies are fragile
   bags of flesh. There's no guarantee one wouldn't get fucked up in it. A
   single moment has the capacity to unravel one's life as they know it. He
   wondered if the people involved in that recorded fight ever felt the anxiety
   of waiting in a hospital lobby unsure if they're going to be functional again
   as they were till then. Felt the horror of confronting permanent
   disfigurement, functional impairment and the subsequent readjustment of life
   expectations. Life can be horrifying in cities- especially when one's body
   ceases to cooperate, makes every day senselessly painful, and reminds one of
   the inability to participate in the hectic smorgasborg of striving and
   doing. 

   The receptionist called out his name requesting payment for the scan.

   Gulshan paid Rs 11000.

   And then he was asked to give his bag to anyone who had come with him while
   he got the scan done in the laboratory room. Gulshan recogized this as the
   first obstacle that confronted him by virtue of him having come alone. There
   was nobody in the room with whom he could trust his medical records, wallet
   and clothes while he got his MRI. The receptionist told him that she'd keep
   it with her. And after deliberating over the matter for a few minutes Gulshan
   recognized this as an unavoidable risk that couldn't be solved at that
   moment. So he entrusted her with his possesions and waited outside the
   laboratory room keeping the pain at bay by singing and rocking himself on the
   couch as a muslim woman looked at him. At this point Gulshan just hoped for the
   pain to stop. The judgment of another couldn't possibly exist on his list of
   concerns at that moment. He went in the dingy room after a bit and after a
   small exchange with the technician, he lay on the narrow bed that would go
   into the tunnel of the MRI machine.

   For the 30 odd minutes in which he lay inside the machine - Gulshan tried not
   to get overwhelmed with emotion. Not just because it might compel some bodily
   movement that might ruin the scan, prolonging the tortuous wait until the
   diagnosis and then any recovery, but because he needed to be certain that he
   could confront such events by himself. Such certainty would be antidote to
   his anxieties in the future and he recognized that perhaps this would be a
   moment of learning for him, instead of one of emotional collapse.

   After the scan, he was told to wait another day. He left the clinic, went
   outside and sat on the pavement. It was six in the evening and the sun wasn't
   as harsh as it was a few hours ago. Gulshan relaxed a bit. He sat on the
   pavement and found some calm in the homogenous sounds of tires on granite and
   the cacophony of vehicles rushing by him. A couple walked by him, holding
   hands and talking sweetly to each other. Gulshan took some heart in that sight
   and recognized his own distance from it. 

   "Where are you?" said another message on his phone. He ignored it and decided
   to find a pharmacy to acquire some painkillers. As he walked along the
   pavement with his medical records in his hand, looking for a pharmacy, he
   crossed a gurudwara and contemplated going inside. 

   Further down the road he crossed a park with some 20somethings playing
   cricket. Some rickshaws with men idling in them. And scores of people walking
   to and fro from the shops surrounding places of worship.

   He eventually arrived at a pharmacy and got the meds as the pharmacist told
   him that even the recluse of a woman who lived upstairs had contracted covid
   and that he was getting over 20 visitors a day asking for scores of
   vaccines. 

   He paid Rs 700. 

   Now he would have to wait until the next day to hear back about the results
   from the test.

   It had been three years since he became ill. And since then he'd abandoned
   all pursuits in his life to recover and become healthier. He gave up his
   deepest aspiraitons from institutions and people around him to overcome the
   loss of his bodily integrity and reconstruct himself so that he could throw
   himself into the world again without disintegrating immediately. Over two
   years, he slowly and carefully climbed out the hell induced by complications
   in his stomach that would bellow out in pain every time he ate something
   unpredictably intolerable to it. in time he found that he was recovering and
   getting better. he could eat more things. he could go about his days with
   more vitality. and then he got hurt again. All his efforts at overcoming his
   ailment seemed moot and wasted as he found himself beyond his usual
   thresholds of pain again.

   On his way back Gulshan listened to some sufi recitations. It occurred to him
   that he didn't have any space or music which was secular and on which he
   relied for comfort and solace. And that at some point in the past, when
   people didn't go about their days consumed with apprehensions about their
   careers and socio-economic mobility, they were consumed with more basic
   concerns of acquiring food, and making through illnesses that they neither
   understood nor could reliably solve. That their day to day living was
   contingent upon more primitive and basic threats, making life a tenuous
   affair which ought to be cherished in moments of painlessness and good
   harvest. Where societal expectations remained limited to acquiring a shelter,
   some bread for the day and painless subsistence. But at some point, there
   must have been some generational shift in the concerns we all harbor. The
   laborer went from worrying about being healthy enough to earn bread to
   worrying about how we could make the transition from a 2bhk to a 3bhk and if
   his wedding would be grand enough. His own concerns, from as far back in his
   childhood seemed to revolve around securing a stellar career and the
   affection of a certain someone he felt itensely for. Bread, good health, and
   shelter were such obvious guarantees that only in his adulthood did he
   recognize these "certainties" as fungible and subject to loss. This
   disturbing confrontation arrived when he found his own certainties threatened
   due to illness and saw for the first time that there still existed vast
   swathes of people for whom this lack of certainty was the norm. What does the
   precariat rely  upon? What did people from centuries ago rely on? People who
   didn't exist in the rarefied bubble of privilege that granted them the
   security that was necessary for one's concerns to shift from "will I be able
   to stave off hunger and pain?" to "will I get my dream job and be good enough
   for those who I love?". To avoid being seized by terror and defeat when
   confronting such an unpredictable existence that is threatened over and over,
   to avoid discovering the parallels between one's life and the tiring, senseless,
   painful, humiliating, sisyphean grind, one needs /some/ justification for
   toiling through this misery. One needs something, anything that can be
   reassuring and stupidly, stubbornly so. That resists the cold dispassionate
   logic that tears one down into precarity day in and day out.  Something to
   justify the bread on the table - even when it's dry and hurts to
   eat. Overwhelming toil necessitates overwhelming defences against the
   collapse of that fundamental unquestioned will to continue living at
   all. What keeps one sane when confronting misery without meaning? The promise
   that things will get better and return to a state of gratifying normalcy?
   And what keeps one sane when it becomes impossible to convince oneself of a
   return to a state of normalcy that's gratifying and painless? When no loved
   one will bring respite. When the doctor or the shaman has given up. When all
   relationships are defined by your extenuating tragedy and are encapsulated by
   their capacity to worsen due to it. In the absence of any music that can
   adequately address such horrors. Or any person who you can visit who can
   meaningfully help. Or any place on the ground made by man where one can go to
   find any comfort that is reasonably convincing and not inadequate.

   
   As he sat in the auto, headed home, Gulshan allowed himself a minor
   delusion. He imagined his pain magically disappear. But magic needs a
   magician. So, he imagined himself being watched with kindness by a mystical 
   figure that had the capacity for both pity and resolving his misery either by
   removing his pain through some magic or by promising him adequate
   compensation for it in the future; possibly finally imparting some meaning
   and consequence to a pain that seemed wanton and pointless until now. Out of
   having no other way to materially or conceptually address it anymore, Gulshan
   allowed himself the comforting fantasy of finding his pain finally addressed
   and alleviated. But this fiction was by itself not particularly
   convincing. Gulshan viscerally felt that pain, at least the kind that he was in
   at that moment, harbored the tendency to persist or grow. Its attentuation
   could only be achieved through some external process. And among such external
   processes, he had arrived at the limit of those made by man. the dead ends of
   medicine, family, love, work and money that all now remained inadequate in
   addressing what Gulshan really wanted. There remained a void that needed
   occupation by a figure that could act as a virtual substitute for them all -
   which would not be inadequate by virtue of its power. Which would not be
   unempathetic or exacting, by virtue of its benevolence and which would have
   enough capacity for pity to allow for the recognition of Gulshan's condition
   and then its subsequent alleviation. With that idea Gulshan planted this seed
   in his head, a deliberate fiction that he allowed himself to take some
   momentary comfort in. What if such a figure existed. Perhaps that figure
   does. A virtual hypothetical imagined figure that plays the role that Gulshan
   wanted it to: made from nothing but his desperate yearning for painlessness
   and salvation from the terrifying anxieties about his future. The more belief
   he put in the idea, the more he found himself comforted and the more he felt
   inclined to convince himself that his belief was justified. 

   And so, on his way home, with nothing else to do, Gulshan listened to verses of
   comfort offered by sufis and imagining for himself, his own oasis - immune to
   the grimy failings of life on earth.

   It was 9PM.
   He reached home, ate sandwiches, took some painkillers and slept. 

   He woke up at 11PM to messages from a close friend who seemed vaguely curious
   about what he had been upto. Gulshan vaguely described his condition and the
   friend suggested he get a second opinion. And since it was late, it might be
   better to do so by visiting the emergency room at a better hospital.

   A second opinion couldn't hurt, Gulshan thought. But it could. He could
   contract covid in the process of visiting another hospital and regret his
   decision immensely. 

   17000 cases. 20% positivity rate. 1 out of every 5 people outside his door
   likey carried a disease that could further worsen his condition. On the other
   hand, his affliction could worsen while waiting for the MRI scans and he
   might discover too late that he needed immediate medical attention.

   respirator, his medical documents and left for the emergency room..</a>
