<b>Considerations on health #1: Your health is being gambled with.</b>

Anyone read a good meta analysis of studies/research that arrive at conclusions through statistical aggregations (like most)?

For example, say a paper "P" is studying the effects of a medicine "X"  on "N" people and finds that it causes:
- extreme side effects on 5% of N
- moderate side effects on 10% of N
- extreme desirable effects on 3% of N
- moderate desirable effects on 45% of N
- mild to no effect on the rest

How does it tell me if X is good for me or not without my having to actually gamble and try substance X?

Since most studies use large populations and observe external effects at scale - it might not be ideal in creating a theoretical "explanatory" model that might help determine if X ought to be taken by an individual or not depending on the specific biological makeup that individual has.  Taking that substance would then come down to tossing a dice and hoping it turns up on the right side. (like with most antidepressants afaik)

This question is probably stupid but i suspect it might have practical ramifications.
Eg in the use of antidepressants as a crude population management tool instead of solving individual brain/body/social issues

TLDR: are there disadvantages to studying substances statistically? Surely this is a new methodology that became possible only recently in the industrial age.

<b> Why am I interested in this?</b>

I was trying to find data published by vaccine companies and realized that there wasn't a good enough explanation that could help me determine IF or HOW i in particular might be in the outlier that develops extreme side effects or not.  And that's alright. But it occurred to me that a lot of medicines and research works that way - statistical analysis that studies their external efficacy and safety at scale. So each time i take a med a doctor gives to me i'm sorta gambling.

Now I have a SUSPICION that this form of research is more predominant because there already is a mechanism in place that can recruit large numbers of people for crude statistical trials. 

So to make your drug marketable/approved you can just get a LOT of people and show:
"Yeah look it works on average with Z confidence interval and L probability*
*some bad side effects in F% of people"

But a more sophisticated analysis might try to recognize the internal mechanism of action for a more precise analysis of how substance X works. And that would require very precise instruments that can somehow observe the ridiculously complex internal chemistry of the body in response to the substance over time.

Also because I'm frustrated by the usual medical approach by doctors who has no explanation over why the med I'm taking is not working. It's almost always "welp, drug X didn't work, let's try drug Y" as if i'm some guinea pig which understandably makes most people /hate/ doctors.

Surely there's some research going on in the area of development of tools that can study body chemistry efficiently. But i wonder if that doesn't get enough funding because it's just easier to do a large "N" study and get a drug approved for marketing by showing statistically significant effects.


<b>Another example:</b>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Interpretation" target="_blank">The guy who invented effect size suggested</a> that 0.2 be called “small”, 0.5 be called “medium”, and 0.8 be called “large”. NICE, a UK health research group, somewhat randomly declared that effect sizes greater than 0.5 be called “clinically significant” and effect sizes less than 0.5 be called “not clinically significant”, but their reasoning was basically that 0.5 was a nice round number, and a few years later they changed their mind and admitted they had no reason behind their decision.

Despite these somewhat haphazard standards, some people have decided that antidepressants’ effect size of 0.3 means they are “clinically insignificant”. Why that? Who knows. So basically the drug one gets prescribed comes through a chain of approval with some arbitrary statistical cutoff points of efficacy that is /entirely/ orthogonal to its specific effect on my own biochemistry.

when it comes to antidepressants the consequences/stakes are high because one is basically biohacking brain chemistry in potentially long term irreversible ways

<b>A path ahead (For the rich?)</b>

Personalized medicine exists apparently. In which, nanotechnology is used to send nanoparticles for medicine deployment, precise imaging, recording and drug delivery. This means that you won't just be bombarded with a drug. There'll be tiny robots managing its interaction with <i>your</i> specific body and ensuring it gets delivered according to your biological responses instead of what was proved <i>statistically</i> in some other trial. The catch is this is expensive. Only the rich can afford this and not like you or me who need to rely on mass aggregate data like sheep managed in herds. But that might change. With technological improvements, this tech will reduce in cost and become accessible to the great unwashed. But by then we'll be confronting other newer, crazier diseases and the wealthier will always have the edge in leading healthier lives apparently.



<b>Disclaimers</b>
Modern medicine saved my life by keeping tuberculosis at bay. I don't mean to say "medicine bad" or reproduce the usual dumb rhetoric perpetuated by fear. But I think a critical analysis of how one engages with medicine and intelligent, responsible decision making is not easy or obvious. We all know fuckall about medicine and it takes a lot of trust to eat potent stuff (pills or non-pills) which we don't understand. This trust has not been earned sufficiently by doctors with god complexes who are oblivious or apathetic to their incompetence.

Speaking of which: When was the last time you heard a doctor admit a mistake? Who exactly is in charge of reviewing a doctor's performance and methods?
