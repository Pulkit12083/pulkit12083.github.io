<h1>Recipes</h1>
Learned from my mother in an effort to preserve priceless culinary luxuries from oblivion. She learned cooking from my grandmother and both these women developed their intuitions in response to the compliments they received from their family - every remark noted and incorporated so that they can eventually prepare meals that their children would come to relish and love in adulthood.

You may or may not like these. I can obviously not speak to your experience. I'm writing these down because I have bad memory.




Some notes:
- I have acute GI issues. 
  So most of my dishes will make a special note for what can be cooked without red/green spices
  
- I dislike the units of measurement used by most recipes. 
  They're confusing, arbitrary and annoying. 
  So I'll make some clarifications here:
** 1 karchi (ladle for adding oil to a dish): around 10 regular spoons (40ml?).
** 1 spoon (a regular sized indian spoon if that makes any sense): around 3/4th a teaspoon I reckon.
** [SF]: Tag to imply it's stomach friendly for those with sensitive digestive systems. 
** [SF] also is an instruction to not add stronger spices to the dish if this is the case.
** 1 indian tomato is(IT) roughly 3/4th the size of an american tomato (AT)
** 1 indian onion (IO) is roughly 1/2 the size of an american onion (AO)
** Most recipes listed are in terms of indian ingredients

- Important: Although I've noted precise instructions and measured ingredient additions, they serve only as defaults. I will certainly play around with ingredients, quantities, and variations and hope you will too. There is no such thing as an 'ideal' recipe.</div>

Add 3 grated onions and caramelise them till they turn dark brown ( on low heat for 30 mins)
Add the marinated chicken, green chillis and some extra curd for gravy and some water
Let the chicken cook and put the lid on the pan
When chicken is cooked, serve with roti or rice

<span class="mw-headline" id="TangySurmai" ><b><font color="#009999">Surmai - Lemon & Tomato</font></b></span>

[SF][fish]

Ingredients: (The proportions I tried)
- Less then 500gms of fish
- One giant tomato (or however much suits you really)
- At least one lemon
- Potatoes (optional but highly recommended)
- Coriander (optional but highly recommended)
- Corn (optional)
- Mushrooms (optional)

Tools:
- A non-stick pan.

Process:
- Season fish with lemon, salt, pepper generously [use other spices you might like]
- (optional; boil a potato or two (for a side) and slice it)
- Glaze the pan with oil (or butter) and heat it up. 
--- I'd recommend oil because butter seems to burn quickly and you'd ideally want to use the leftover oil in the pan to make eggs or another side
- Toss some corn into the pan (if you'd like that as a side too)
- Place the fish (and also optionally the sliced boiled potato) in the pan
- Fry on each side on medium heat for about 3-4 minutes
- Remove the potatoes and fish and put them on a plate.

[You might want to do this quickly to avoid letting the fish get cold]
- In the leftover oils/juices in the pan, add some amount of finely chopped onions/shallots
- Let them fry for a bit and then add grated tomato.
- Let that cook until it's sufficiently done
- pour this gravy on the cooked fish
- add some coriander
- optionally serve with scrambled eggs

The combination of lemon and tomato is quite sour and tangy and probably not for everyone. But I enjoyed it quite a bit. YMMV.

<span class="mw-headline" id="Basics"><b><h3>Staple foods</h3></b></span>The basics. Humble dishes cooked, boiled or fried made from everyday ingredients when the luxury of embellished cooking in life is a bit out of reach. Most curried staples follow the same formula with minor variations (stirfry(onions,tomatoes) with spices and then subsequently mix with boiled beans/pulses or cooked vegetables when done). The spices listed here seem precise but needn't be. variation is helpful.

</div>
<div class="transbox3">
<font color="#009999">Some notes about Indian staples:</font>
- Essentials: 2 onions, 2 tomatoes, spices(salt,turmeric,coriander,red,ginger)
- With these you'll be able to make a fry to which you can add pretty much anything 
  (boiled beans, potatoes, veggies etc)

<font color="#009999">- Tools:</font>
--* Pressure cooker: yields a significant advantage in boiling quicker, destroys fewer nutrients
--* Kadhai: big metal bowl:
------> seems to allow for oil to collect in the center in a pool which allows for better frying
------> ubstituted for nonstick pan BUT they don't get too hot and have low smoking points :(
--* Ladle/karchi: makes a difference when stir frying. karchi/khurpi seem well suited for curries/fries. 
--* long handles are better.

<font color="#009999">- Oil:</font>
--* Refined oil for curries
--* Gheea/Toree: Desi ghee (substitute for above)
--* Sarson ka oil for dry vegetables: healthier although tricky to get right with curries

<font color="#009999">- Miscellaneous but optional additions:</font>
--* bay leaves to curries

<span class="mw-headline" id="Oatmeal" ><b><font color="#009999">Oatmeal</font></b></span>

delicious, nourishing and healthy breakfast.

Tools: microwavaeble bowl

Process:
- dip some oatmeal in enough water or milk (preferably coconut milk) to submerge it.
- microwave for 2.5 minutes
- add all sorts of stuff:
--- almonds
--- blueberries
--- pumpkin seeds
--- honey
- mix
- toppings:
--- banana slices

this is my staple replacement for paranthas as breakfast.

Staple lunch.
[SF][mild difficulty, quick, 1 utensil dish]
[serves 3]

Ingredient list:
- Brinjal - 2
- Tomatoes - 2 (large)
- Spices - Salt, Coriander, Ginger, (Red: opt)
- Oil (Refined preferrable)

Tools:
- kadhai - 2 (or a nice metal frying pan shall do)
- Flame stove
- Prongs - to pick and turn the roasted brinjal on flame
- Madhani - a wooden stick (or anything that works) to mash cooked brinjal with

Process

I: Roasting the plant
- 2 Medium flames
- Use the metal grill to place a brinjal on each
- Turn every 2~3 minutes when you notice the side exposed to the flame flaking 
- Carefully note if it's draining water into the flame/stove. if so, turn.
- "Roast" till the whole sphere seems to be flaking and soft
- Stab to check if it's soft on the inside
- Take both brinjal spheres off the flame and put on a plate
- Cover with a lid for 7ish minutes (till it's cool enough to touch)
- Remove black skin flakes with fingers
---* This should be kind of hot and uncomfortable. 
---* If it's too cold then you've waited too long and mashing it will be harder
- Wash the remaining flakes under running cold water off the brinjal
- Pry open the plant and check for insects/worms and remove if you see any
---* If you feel any "stiff/hard" uncooked spots in the plant, microwave for a minute (no more!)
- Place the two brinjal plants (yellowish in color) in a bowl
- Use the madhani to mash both plants till you get a soft but thick and semi-uniform paste

II: Fry (cooked on medium)
- Heat up 1 karchi oil
- [OPTIONAL (I don't do this): Add an onion and wait for it to brown]
- Add 2 big tomatoes 
- Add 1/2 spoon salt, 1/2 spoon coriander, 1/3 spoon ginger powder (mayyybe a little more?)
- Cook till the fry begins to excrete oil and has become thicker
- Add brinjal paste and mix super thoroughly
- Let it cook on medium for 5ish minutes max
- fin

i quite like this summer lunch. best had with chapatis. 
Possible side dishes: ??
Possible improvements: ?? (onions, other spices - like garam masala?)
