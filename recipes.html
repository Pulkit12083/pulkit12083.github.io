<h1>Recipes</h1>
Mostly learned from my mother in an effort to preserve priceless culinary luxuries from inevitable oblivion. You may or may not like these. I can obviously not speak to your experience. I'm writing these down because I have bad memory.



<a href="index.html" style="color:#009999;"><*- not hungry. just take me home.</a>

Some notes:
- I have acute GI issues. 
  So most of my dishes will make a special note for what can be cooked without red/green spices
  
- I dislike the units of measurement used by most recipes. 
  They're confusing, arbitrary and annoying. 
  So I'll make some clarifications here:
** 1 karchi (ladle for adding oil to a dish): around 10 regular spoons (40ml?).
** 1 spoon (a regular sized indian spoon if that makes any sense): around 3/4th a teaspoon I reckon.
** [SF]: Tag to imply it's stomach friendly for those with sensitive digestive systems. 
** [SF] also is an instruction to not add stronger spices to the dish if this is the case.
** 1 indian tomato is(IT) roughly 3/4th the size of an american tomato (AT)
** 1 indian onion (IO) is roughly 1/2 the size of an american onion (AO)
** Most recipes listed are in terms of indian ingredients

- <font color="#009999">Important: Although I've noted precise instructions and measured ingredient additions, they serve only as defauls</font> I will certainly play around with ingredients, quantities, and variations and hope you will too. There is no such thing as an 'ideal' recipe.

<span class="mw-headline" id="Basics"><b><h3>Staple foods</h3></b></span>The basics. Humble dishes cooked, boiled or fried made from everyday ingredients when the luxury of embellished cooking in life is a bit out of reach. Most curried staples follow the same formula with minor variations (stirfry(onions,tomatoes) with spices and then subsequently mix with boiled beans/pulses or cooked vegetables when done). The spices listed here seem precise but needn't be. variation is helpful.
</div>

<font color="#009999">Some notes about Indian staples:</font>
- Essentials: 2 onions, 2 tomatoes, spices(salt,turmeric,coriander,red,ginger)
- With these you'll be able to make a fry to which you can add pretty much anything 
  (boiled beans, potatoes, veggies etc)

<font color="#009999">- Tools:</font>
--* Pressure cooker: yields a significant advantage in boiling quicker, destroys fewer nutrients
--* Kadhai: big metal bowl:
------> seems to allow for oil to collect in the center in a pool which allows for better frying
------> ubstituted for nonstick pan BUT they don't get too hot and have low smoking points :(
--* Ladle/karchi: makes a difference when stir frying. karchi/khurpi seem well suited for curries/fries. 
--* long handles are better.

<font color="#009999">- Oil:</font>
--* Refined oil for curries
--* Gheea/Toree: Desi ghee (substitute for above)
--* Sarson ka oil for dry vegetables: healthier although tricky to get right with curries

<font color="#009999">- Miscellaneous but optional additions:</font>
--* bay leaves to curries

<span class="mw-headline" id="Rice" ><b><font color="#009999">Rice</font></b></span>

<span class="mw-headline" id="Bartha"><b><font color="#009999">Bartha (Brinjal/Eggplant)</font></b></span>

Staple lunch.
[SF][mild difficulty, quick, 1 utensil dish]
[serves 3]

Ingredient list:
- Brinjal - 2
- Tomatoes - 2 (large)
- Spices - Salt, Coriander, Ginger, (Red: opt)
- Oil (Refined preferrable)

Tools:
- kadhai - 2 (or a nice metal frying pan shall do)
- Flame stove
- Prongs - to pick and turn the roasted brinjal on flame
- Madhani - a wooden stick (or anything that works) to mash cooked brinjal with

Process

I: Roasting the plant
- 2 Medium flames
- Use the metal grill to place a brinjal on each
- Turn every 2~3 minutes when you notice the side exposed to the flame flaking 
- Carefully note if it's draining water into the flame/stove. if so, turn.
- "Roast" till the whole sphere seems to be flaking and soft
- Stab to check if it's soft on the inside
- Take both brinjal spheres off the flame and put on a plate
- Cover with a lid for 7ish minutes (till it's cool enough to touch)
- Remove black skin flakes with fingers
---* This should be kind of hot and uncomfortable. 
---* If it's too cold then you've waited too long and mashing it will be harder
- Wash the remaining flakes under running cold water off the brinjal
- Pry open the plant and check for insects/worms and remove if you see any
---* If you feel any "stiff/hard" uncooked spots in the plant, microwave for a minute (no more!)
- Place the two brinjal plants (yellowish in color) in a bowl
- Use the madhani to mash both plants till you get a soft but thick and semi-uniform paste

II: Fry (cooked on medium)
- Heat up 1 karchi oil
- [OPTIONAL (I don't do this): Add an onion and wait for it to brown]
- Add 2 big tomatoes 
- Add 1/2 spoon salt, 1/2 spoon coriander, 1/3 spoon ginger powder (mayyybe a little more?)
- Cook till the fry begins to excrete oil and has become thicker
- Add brinjal paste and mix super thoroughly
- Let it cook on medium for 5ish minutes max
- fin

i quite like this summer lunch. best had with chapatis. 
Possible side dishes: ??
Possible improvements: ?? (onions, other spices - like garam masala?)
