<h1>Recipes</h1>
Mostly learned from my mother in an effort to preserve priceless culinary luxuries from inevitable oblivion. You may or may not like these. I can obviously not speak to your experience. I'm writing these down because I have bad memory.



<a href="index.html" style="color:#009999;"><*- not hungry. just take me home.</a>

Some notes:
- I have acute GI issues. 
  So most of my dishes will make a special note for what can be cooked without red/green spices
- I dislike the units of measurement used by most recipes. 
  They're confusing, arbitrary and annoying. 
  The tools available in one country aren't in another.
  It's silly to use the metric system for everyday cooking.
- So I'll make some clarifications here:
** 1 karchi (curved serving spoon for adding oil to a dish): around 40 ml?
** 1 spoon (a regular sized indian spoon if that makes any sense): around 3/4th a teaspoon I reckon.
** [SF]: Tag to imply it's stomach friendly for those with sensitive digestive systems. 
** [SF] also is an instruction to not add stronger spices to the dish if this is the case.
** 1 indian tomato is(IT) roughly 3/4th the size of an american tomato (AT)
** 1 indian onion (IO) is roughly 1/2 the size of an american onion (AO)
** Most recipes listed are in terms of indian ingredients

Let this empty space stand here as a testament to my shame for not having learned how to (partly due to lack of access to a working oven). Will fill this up when I learn a thing or two (teach me Annie?)
