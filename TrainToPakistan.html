   <b>The god of small things (and train to pakistan)</b>
  
   I recently read /Train to Pakistan/ by Khushwant Singh. And /The god of small
   things/ by Arundhati Roy over two months ago. The two are comparable on
   several counts and yet differ on some that are crucial enough for me to find
   one a tedious read and the other a valuable one. 

   It took me over a month to read The god of small things. Every now and then
   I'd pick it up, read the florid descriptions of Ayemenem and the characters
   with mysterious pasts that remained to be revealed and give up about 50 to
   100 pages in. Remarkably pretty language to describe a relatively rustic
   rural town. Then, determined to finish the book one weekend, i read it
   all. It's largely a contemptuous commentary on the largely orthodox
   provincial bigotry of almost every sort of person one might find in rural
   India. I say "almost" because exempt from such contempt are the two
   passive children, their mother and a dalit worker who retain affections for
   each other while remaining at the nexus of harm, violence and the stifling
   roles to which they're reduced by everyone around them. The children
   serving as the perspective of naive, innocent conscientiousness through which
   we observe the grand and complex tapestry of uniquely indian bigotry,
   intolerance and idealism which plays out through patriarchal, casteist,
   religious, communist, powerful, egotistical, regressive men and sometimes
   even the women who play their own part in sustaining the ideas that emerge
   from a traditional indian upbringing that upholds social status, caste, and
   roles with their rules of social, public and private grace as paramount above
   all.  Arundhati's self insert is evidently the mother of the two children in
   the book, intelligent, extremely cutting, assertive, ideologically
   independent yet hopelessly mired and caught in the hell raised by the rigid
   orthodoxy of her family and ultimately dependent on them until she dies as a
   solitary unattended figure in a hospital deprived of her children and
   ultimately any care from a family that has not only abandoned her but played
   active part in tearing her life asunder - particularly helped by a scheming
   aunt who bitterly resents a dalit worker and successfully plots to implicate
   him as a murdering kidnapper of children. She strikes home the festering
   orthodox rural rot amid the most grandiloquent and pretty similies and
   metaphors, liberally describing the natural scene, sights, visions, scents
   and poetic enchanting exoticisms of rural india as they might appear to a
   city dweller. The book is unabashedly romantic about suffering, tragedy and
   the lives of the victims at the center of the book - who try their best to
   avert misfortune but due to the complicity of everyone in their village -
   from the brutal and malicious policement to the casteist aunt and the
   spineless careerist communist politician, are unable to overcome the tragedy
   that leaves the dalit worker dead, the mother relegated to a solitary life of
   deprivation until early death and children who grow up traumatized, separated
   and alienated from everyone but each other until they reunite decades later.

   This book has value. It's a sharp denunciation of casteism and its
   practioners, of male figures that beat their wives, of city educated men who
   believe themselves to be god's gift to everyone, of the police, of men on the
   street who molest children, of religious dogma and the stunningly regressive
   and rigid intolerances of authority figures in india. Her sly digs at the
   petty hipocrysy that pervades indian families is gratifying. 


   It's also pornographic. Literally so in that it contains a pornographic chapter in
   which the mother (ammachi) is described in explicit detail as making love to
   the dalit worker. And figuratively so in that the book romanticizes
   everything in it - from the grand suffering of its oppressed, to the quixotic
   and uniquely sensorily dense scapes of rural kerala, to the malice inherent
   in the politics and thinking of the people who inhabit it. Intense emotion
   acts as the central figure of aestheticized experience and animates every
   character roy is empathetic towards. Traditional orthodoxy and political
   cunning animates those that she isn't. 

   
   It becomes tedious in the middle and the florid literary descriptions become
   less charming and more grating as I hoped she'd arrive to the event she
   alludes to throughout the book - the nature of which is not hard to
   anticipate. I became bored and apathetic to the book after the middle and
   found the literary embellishment of grief and sentiment sort of heavy
   handed. I would rather read this same book but written more factually - if
   that makes sense, without the beautified literary descriptions of abuse,
   lynching, untouchability and caste politics.  At some point one begins to
   find analogies, metaphors etc forced or silly or reaching, as if the point
   was to appreciate the narrator's imagination and capacity to make suffering
   sexy, and grand. Something that makes me uncomfortable. Is casteist brutality
   up for commodification and leisurely consumption in the form of novels now? I
   perhaps am not entitled to publicly hold any opinion in this. Cancel culture
   has determined that by virtue of my gender/caste/class I'm entitled to no
   political opinion and consequently no opinion of consequence. But by the same
   criterion, is arundhati roy? Perhaps she is, because she's a woman and a social
   activist who seems to be financially comfortable and famous enough to draw
   light to this issue. What about caste? 

   <b>Train to Pakistan.</b>

   This one is more simply written. With few, if any, pretensions to literary
   grandeur and carrying no aestheticisms that romanticize suffering of
   violence. It's an accessible story, almost a fable, about a remote fictional
   village called "mano majra" that lives in relative predictable harmony with
   an affectionate fraternity between the two major religious communities in
   it - the sikhs and the muslims who cohabit the same place with a shared sense
   of community until trains carrying thousands of dead bodies of sikhs/muslims
   murdered through communal rioting pass through the village and a bureaucrat
   institutes a plan for driving the muslims to pakistan. The villagers are
   simple minded. They're not inherently malicious. They're not yet capable of
   deep seated generation long hatred for women, children, and figures from a
   different caste. They're religious and seem inclined to do what is
   good. The sikh in the village weep profoundly when they discover that their
   muslim 'brothers', 'chacha' and villagers are forced to leave without proper
   farewell and experience genuine sorrow at the destruction of their houses and
   their property being looted. However, the genocidal riots of partition
   yielding rivers flooded with corpses fallen victim to religious rioting puts
   the sikhs of the village in significant unrest and sorrow that remains in a
   state of passive acceptance to fate, as one passively accepts the havoc of
   seasons sent by God, until a rioter comes to the village and incites the
   sikhs to murder every muslim heading to pakistan on a train - which includes
   the muslims that till a few days ago would inhabit their own village.

   The people in this book are understandable. The way they think requires no
   romantic devices and they don't harbor profound and intense schemes involving
   their internal feelings of the right place for each in their role in the
   village. Their lives, roles, and forms of living are ordinary to them and
   involve no grandiose everyday sufferings. A grand tragedy does befall the
   village but Khushwant singh describes it factually, minimally, simply and
   without embellishment. From rural religiosity, to authoritorial servility to
   the government and a corrupt police that beats its criminals with the same
   banal incompetence and unemotional function, to the absence of logic in
   deliberation over communal matters. It contains no complex mystery and enigma
   that requires unfolding, time jumps, flashbacks. A linear story with linear
   minds.
   
   The rhetoric used to incite fickle village mobs and rouse communal sentiment
   to slaughter muslims on their way to Pakistan is not unknown to anyone in this
   country. The communist is just as much of a careerist but less likely to
   implicate another worker and more likely to drink whiskey and doze off away
   from violence. This communist, a weak, intellectual, disconnected city
   educated idealist who is entirely impotent in the context of a rural village
   and resorts to nihilist despair in the face of tragedy is not unrecognizable
   to me. Perhaps an older version of him might have resembled roy's
   communist politician. But he harbors none of the secret romantic feelings of
   political cunning that roy's machiavellian figures do. Neither do the
   religious folk of the village. Nor do the police, who're incompetent
   bootlickers who can hardly interpret simple commands from the visiting
   bureaucrat easily. These figures, the way they speak, how they act, I
   understand. Their parochial easy to sway dispositions I can easily locate in
   the context of a village. Roy's figures are too dense and profoundly evil for
   me to grasp them too well. Khushwant singh narrates tragedy without
   prettifying the whole affair to make it sound any grander than it is. Women
   despair theatrically in his villages instead of profoundly and
   romantically. The men shrug them off instead of scheme to dispossess them of
   their property and deprived of their children. Caste does not exist in this
   book, likely to heavy a topic that already deals with ethic cleansing. But if
   a book were to be written about caste, I'd prefer to read one by Khushwant
   singh for his relatively unaffected methods of representing people.



   <b>The questions that immediately haunt me:</b>

   If said contrasts are legitimate at all - involve how much of traditional life as
   described by khushwant singh and roy is a matter of everyday suffering to its
   people and how much of it is ordinary reality - as singh notes inequality is
   a matter of fact in india when juggah is given a worse cell than the educated
   communist?

   Is it a matter of difference in the type of communities and size of
   village/city, a difference in south or north india or just a difference in
   time [singh having written this far earlier than roy]?

   How much of this difference in how the characters that are etched is
   attributible to violence emerging from casteism compared to violence emerging
   from communal rioting?

   How much of this is attributable to the difference in cities/villages?

   How much of this is attributable to the difference in lengths of the two
   novels - did khushwant singh limit to the external functional simplistic
   descriptions of villagers due to constraints of length?

   How much of this is attributable to the either author's inclination to probe
   the internal psyches and emotive intentions of people?

   How much of this is attributable to the audience either author is seeking to
   reach; roy writing for a more international, literary crowd while singh
   presumably for the more common indian.
   

   <b>How banal is suffering and tragedy really? And is that determined by who
   speaks and portrays it?</b>

   ----

   Side note:

   Sp B, a close friend, throws the idea of fiction that presents an
   argument. Does all fiction do this trivially through representation? Is
   representation the same as providing an argument? Or is there a difference
   between description and argument? On one hand there's didactic fiction that
   is simplistic and childish and moralistic - fables with moral lessons, but is
   there an equivalent to this that does something more interesting? I posited
   that like science which represents structures as is and then constructs a
   model of functioning depending on said representation, fiction like roy's god
   of small things might do something similar by describing a model of
   reality/life/people and the functioning of said perspectives. It runs into
   the humean problem of induction. Maybe one can describe, represent but not
   argue. And especially not so with fiction (as compared to observation,
   history and reality), but Sp B suggests that one uses fictional hypothesis
   for arguing in and out of science all the time. Perhaps fiction can be used
   to argue. But to be somewhat sure that it doesn't reduce to a truism, i have
   to find examples of fiction that does not argue using this logic. Ruskin bond
   doesn't argue. Nabokov doesn't. Chekhov doesn't sometimes and does
   sometimes. Roy argues. I need to think about this more.
