<div class="transbox" style="display:block;">
yuki wakes up to the sound of a rain tapping the metal banister of his balcony. despite the pains acquired from a recent accident necessitating ample bed rest, yuki decides to leave his room. he gets up, instinctively reaches for his phone but then decides against having anything to do with it. he grabs a mango instead and walks outdoors unencumbered with the responsibilities that usually come with that black rectangular object that promises to "connect" him to those in distant places and among whom yuki had hitherto strived to find his place and his justifications for acquiescing to the transformation and contortions they belabored.

He slices the mango in three pieces and holding them goes for a walk beneath the green wet canopy of trees that line the streets around the government school near his place. Nobody else is outside. There is likely someone watching him from some balcony higher up in building hierarchies than he can afford but he does not care anymore. A magpie flies across yuki's path and perches on a layer of wet yellow glazed leaves on the windshield of an old car right below a tree. The fresh coat of water and fallen twigs, branches, leaves, pollen seem to decorate even the most pedestrian objects in ways that make them seem less harrowing than they usually are to pedestrians navigating the city. Yuki looks up and finds a grey blanket of clouds illuminated by the mellow early morning sun behind them. These are exceptional circumstances in this city and yuki finds some subtle comfort in the knowledge that such exceptions are still possible - the kind that disrupt the usual order of things, thoughts, speech, activities and organization of men and women around him. Yuki digs his teeth into the mango until his gums meet the cold and soft fruit with its sweet juices enveloping his tongue almost instantly and some running down his fingers, knuckles, palm and wrist. Yuki doesn't mind. H devours the mango under the sound of thunder and a cold windy rain that now has him completely drenched. He walks ahead and enters a poorly maintained and deserted public garden caught between the rows of multistoreyed apartment units that had recently sprung up nearby. The only visitors of this garden included him and a stray cat who occasionally approached yuki for play. today it was just him in the rectangular garden with a bougainvillea in one corner and a giant peepal tree taller than the buildings nearby shimmering and swaying and keeping some of the torrent from reaching yuki. he looks up to see its heart shaped leaves flutter and oscillate on their fragile green twigs, resisting the onslaught of the wind in a manner that yuki surmised must surely be out of some sort of magic. as yuki sits cross-legged beneath the tree, he thinks about nothing, cares about nothing. not from the past, or the future. no abstractions haunt him yet. only the visceral sensations of a fruit enveloping his tongue and rain enveloping his skin. he notices a red flower growing on a plant nearby and pluccks a petal and rests it on his knee and decides to look at it. really look.

eventually it stops raining and the sun begins to shin through the leaves above him - creating an umbra on the different shades of green of the grass on which his hand is resting - for support and because yuki likes how the grass and the soil tickle his palm. 

he looks up at the sun, gradually realizing that it had been a while since he did that with some degree of gladness, appreciated the fact that he could still do so, got up and resumed his walk. yuki finds a fallen treee branch. he picks it up and decides to use it as a walking stick. It is heavy but he doesn't mind the opportunity for holding a comically large branch as a walking aid if it allows him to clasp his grip around the wet bark weakened and flaking off due to the depredations caused by water. he walks between rows of silent houses with no signs of people inhabiting them exclaiming a hearty soliloquy describing the imagined end of days brought by the forces of nature that had humbled everyone around him in the recent past. 

by the time yuki was done amusing himself. he came to the end of the pretty street lined with trees and turned a corner to find the main road roaring with traffic, the sound of tires on granite, car horns and the smells of putrid petroleum mixing with petrichor. he decided to walk the main road with the same sort of gladness and smallness from the moment before he turned the corner: the juncture at which he became cognizant of the fusion of two kinds of nature he had hitherto been almost acclimated to - the wooden kind that sprung from the soil and the metallic kind that sprung from the furnaces of factories. his vision of the sky unoccluded by any canopy of leaves now revealed to him a grey expanse in which cloud and smoke were indistinguishible. so were the scents of leaves decaying and of rats of feasting on litter. the din of nearby traffic, the rustle of trees, and muffled conversations between clothed humans milling around in front of him. 

this fusion constituted every way of life yuki had ever known. that sustained his being and nourished his life, its ideas and trifles. sun and smoke. noise and music. the nature that both alienated him and invigorated him in its own twisted ways. yuki decides to make peace with the semi-industrial scape and continues to walk on broken footpaths with holes wide enough to swallow children whole until they met their creators in the watery labyrinths of underground canals carrying the city's excretions into its most sacred river.  He walks along white marble shops selling religious idols, across autowallas cutting his path and beside speeding SUVs that will surely at some point kill or maim some anonymous ignoble who couldn't afford for himself the luxuries of a safer existence. yuki walks past stacks of iron rods, marble and granite sold by construction vendors that lined the main road - basic building blocks for the urban jungle of which yuki was a small and humble creature. yuki walks past massive trucks parked on pedestrian sidewalks occupying public space - larger, less humble creatures that become active at night and move around iron and concrete needed for the jungle and its primary pestilence to grow. 

yuki eventually arrives at a foot overbridge and decides to use its small elevation to rise in some petty fashion above the features of the scene around him. He walks up the dilapidated and crumbling stairs and walks the bridge until he arrives at the middle. 


He hears and acknowledges the raging, thunderous, frenetic, impatient howling of a massive metallic horde racing beneath him on the main road. He sees a the city metro with grey concrete pillars elevating its track and taut electric wires running parrallel to the road on the left. Beneath which is a gurudwara, a shopping mall and an electronics store selling more black rectangular objects like the kind yuki left at home. on his right are shops, apartment units and factories. the foot overbridge is shaking, vibrating and humming ever so slightly. it might crumble and fall but yuki finds comfort in the knowledge that if it does, his end would be quick. he looks up and sees the setting sun illuminating half the sky in shades of yellow that always went so well with the beige, pink and yellow cubes of apartments that characterized this city. the other half of the sky was dark blue and velvet meeting the granite horizon lined with street lights that were being turned on by some distant human in a different yellow cube somewhere. 

yuki recognizes how small he is. an insect beneath the larger forces of nature - a cog moved by both rain and the whims of powerful governers. he felt the authority of this giant mass that people called society that comrpised of the powerful who decided the climate of his institutional life, his capacity to alleviate his hunger and breathe, the weak who meekly herded along the few lines etched out for them and the insane whose strength and fortitude depended upon the sheer incomprehensibility of their esoteric deviances. given what yuki saw and felt on that bridge, he felt a vague and distant understanding for an insanity as an adaptation to this normal.

yuki notices people walking past him on the bridge now. carrying backpacks and suitcases, exhausted, with a steady pace that he recognized intimately as resulting from the quiet patience that is often needed in the trek back home from a day of labour that infused life into this modern pandemonium. 

yuki out of his exhaustion decides to head back to his yellow cube too - with some vague intentions on cultivating a parochial consciousness of the immediate and necessary but renouncing any grander ambitions or hopes beyond that which permitted basic survival and the capacity to find the few vestiges of goodness in this semi-industrial phantasmagoria of dread and dream. not fully ready to resume normal daily life but tacitly accepting the order and arrangement of life around him in a way that he never had before.
