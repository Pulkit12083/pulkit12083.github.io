   yuki is laying on his back. he doesn't know what time it
   is. and he doesn't need to. even his grandest schemes don't seem
   to warrant knowing it at that moment. he looks idly at the
   sky above him. the part that was visible at least. he's on a
   charpai in a small courtyard with white walls surrounding an uneven
   ground seemingly made of white bricks and grey stone. Beyond these
   white walls, on two sides are tall buildings with red brick walls
   that yuki guesses must be at least four stories high. on another
   side is a tall yellow building the most remarkable feature of which
   is its balcony that looks at an unobstructed view of the sky. yuki
   occasionally glances at that balcony. partly because he wants to
   see for himself if the people who live there derive as much
   contentment as he believes one might up there. And partly because
   that's the only place from where he might be seen by another. He
   can't hear or see much activity. The day is listless, silent and
   still, and lends to the intuition that it won't be visited for a
   while. 

   above all these tall brick buildings beyond the white
   walls of this courtyard is the patch of light blue sky that has
   yuki's attention. almost certainly because he's on his back and
   turning his neck to watch anything else might warrant more
   inconvenience or effort than is warranted by a day like this. so
   yuki continues looking upward. every now and then a bird enters
   this patch of blue and lingers there tracing arcs and circles above
   him for several minutes, before inevitably leaving. and soon
   followed by another. yuki is trying to mentally sketch the lines
   they follow. maybe this would reveal an underlying pattern in their
   movement. if not, it would still be a pleasant form of aesthetic
   play that yuki just felt like indulging for its own sake. as he lay
   still on his back, he becomes conscious of his eyes moving and
   following the birds from one point in the sky to another. he feels
   his hands pressed between the back of his head and the interwoven
   threads of the cot beneath him. and then later aware of a fly on
   his toe that he manages to evict with his other foot. 

   and then there aren't any birds to look at. his gaze wanders off to
   the distant corner in the courtyard which has a small tree beneath
   which is some older discarded furniture and a trunk gathering
   dust. he follows the white walls of the courtyard from that corner,
   moving across a door behind which is a room he's vaguely familiar
   with and arriving at the wall nearest to him which is coated with
   slaked lime and after decades of wear seems to have developed its
   own design replete with patterns formed by plaster chipping off
   bit by bit, exposing the lime wall behind it. Yuki goes closer to
   inspect and finds, to his delight, a trail of ants scaling it. 


   he rubs his fingertip against the wall and after briefly inspecting
   the patch of white dust coating on his skin, he looks at the ants
   again. all exceedingly tiny, even for ants, forming thin vertical
   lines the origin and ends of which disappear into tiny nooks and
   crevasses. one of the ants climbs his fingertip. yuki withdraws his
   hand and looks at the tiniest at he's seen traverse his
   skin. it walks over his nail, knuckles, his palm and then his
   thumb, stopping every few seconds to change its direction ever so
   slightly. as the ant walks across the lines on his palm, yuki
   becomes conscious of his hands and their features too. he looks at
   them closesly and wonders if he'll grow up to be someone who can
   put them to good use. yuki moves away from the wall, leaving all
   lifeforms inhabiting it in peace.  and then he begins to admire how
   each brick on the wall nearby is different from the other.


   yuki hasn't yet developed any intuitions over what is the
   acceptable amount of living space one needs and consider how much
   he can afford for himself, how much he needs for himselfm how
   much he wants for himself, or for others and why. when he looks at
   a wall with red bricks, his primary concerns revolve around not
   being able to inspect each brick closely enough.


   yuki's parents are inside, talking to his aunts and uncles about
   things that he doesn't care about, and is exempt from caring
   about. their conversations are the same as ever - bus routes,
   weather, the next religious event, a conspicuous politician on TV,
   trifles at work and the minor inconveniences of everyday life that
   yield all the cliches that comprise of their wisdom.

   yuki is 6.

   yuki isn't taken seriously and is currently permitted to
   idle away from the conversation under the condition he not stray too
   far. this is an acceptable arrangement for him considering that he
   doesn't feel the need to do so at the moment. the objects that
   surround him currently have much to offer. at some point his
   parents will decide it's time to head back home on the rattling
   scooter on which he'll stand between his father and its steering
   wheel. on arriving home, yuki will read a book, watch some TV and
   sleep. 

   He'll grudgingly wake up at 6:45 AM the next day and try to sleep
   on the way to school but won't be able to. classes pose little
   challenge to him and hearing the teacher with the book in front of
   him is equivalent to a sort of play that he's not unfamiliar
   with. he has no friends. because the concept of a friend doesn't
   exist yet in his world. there are only names, of faces around him
   that he recognizes and associates with different crude thoughts and
   feelings which govern his interactions unmabiguously. he cannot
   recognize contradiction in desire and as far as he is concerned,
   there doesn't exist any in his own. he'll come home, eat lunch,
   watch TV, read a pop science book on astronomy in his room, loiter
   in the verandah and try to find the cricket he can hear nearby,
   fail at doing so, and then go to sleep.
   
   yuki finds adventure in the few odd books that he has inadvertently
   acquired from around him. picked up from a hospital lobby. from a
   neighbor who is moving out. from a cousin who had one laying
   around. another from his mother's friend whose daughter wants to
   make space in her room. it cannot be said that he enjoys
   reading. it's just something he does for reprieve from boredom on
   days where his tiny world begins to exhibit a hint of
   banality. 

   he has not yet to begun to conceptualize any framework under which
   he will have to make any of the choices that adults make around
   him. he largely imagines them as unhappy and perpetually
   discontent - if not due to their jobs then because of each
   other. but yuki is not worried. he has time. for now, his days are
   empty and unexceptional and without knowing it explicitly, he finds
   contentment in their provincial repitition. he believes that his
   recognition of the unhappiness around him will be exactly what
   exempts him from it - because he is convinced that as long as he's
   good at school, he will eventually have a bright and successful
   life void of most petty frustrations and defeats that seemingly
   consume those around him. for now, however, he feels glad to exist
   as a distant observer. he is often asked by his family why he
   doesn't speak 

   he's scolded for talking too little at home. too much at
   school. but he finds it difficult to even remember the accusations
   beyond an hour. his justifications are either self evident or
   entirely inaccessible.
   
   yuki is 6. he is still capable of harboring joys unpoisoned by the
   insidious indictments levied by judgments he would eventually begin
   perceive in all his conversations with people around him and then
   later with the mirror.

   yuki is 6. still incapable of the ruthless skepticism that would
   grow to develop into the emotional scissor pruning any and all
   satisfactions down to a reasonable degree of cautious optimisms.

   nothing will change any time soon.
