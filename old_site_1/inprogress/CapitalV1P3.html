<b><u>Chapter 7: The Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>

The last chapter discussed the public sphere of the market where the capitalist purchases labour power as a commodity with the intent of augmenting the value of the materials he owns. This chapter describes the process by which this is achieved - the creation of surplus value.

Two sections.
The first describes the labour process - a tangible, physical transformation of natural raw material from dirt to product by the application of physical human effort - to create use values.
The second describes how the capitalist uses this process to create surplus value despite not physically participating in the above process.

Section 1: The labour-process or the production of use-values
1. Labour is a process, in which man and nature participate. Man appropriates nature using his own forces and transforms it, develops it in ways that suit his needs and wants. By working on soil to make it yield fruit, by herding and controlling cattle to aid in the process, and altering raw material to create products for consumption or tools and implements that allow for further development and sophistication of the means of production.

2. The labour process is an everlasting condition imposed on man by nature- ergo independent and common to every such social phase of history/existence.

3. Under the control of the capitalist, the labour process exhibits two properties:
3a. the labourer works under the capitalist's control whose ensures there is no needless waste of raw material, or unnecessary depreciation of the implements he owns.
3b. the final product is the property of the capitalist and not the labourer who is that product's immediate producer. The product of this process belongs, therefore, to him, just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar.

"The elementary factors of the labour-process are 1, the personal activity of man, i.e., work itself, 2, the subject of that work, and 3, its instruments."

Section 2:
Arriving at the conclusion that the final product made by the application of labour on raw materials does not have value that exceeds the sum of the values of the labor and raw materials congealed into it. Then describes how the capitalist gets around this. By using labour for longer than the bare minimum time required for the labourer to produce the amount of value required for self subsistence.

The crux of the argument is given by example:
* A laborer can spin 10 units of cotton into 10 units of yarn in 6 hours of labor - the combined cost of which is say 15 shillings (12 shillings for 10-cotton and 3 shillings for 6 hours of labour).
* The product; 10 units of yarn therefore is valued at 15 shillings which the capitalist has dispensed
* However, the laborer is given 20 units of cotton and made to work for 12 hours for the same amount of compensation as for 6 hours of labour- producing 30 shillings worth of yarn (12+12+6) for which the capitalist paid 27 (12+12+3) shillings. The added 3 shillings, surplus value, were congealed in the yarn though the additional 6 hours of work the labourer put in.

<u><b>Notable excerpts and remarks</b></u>
<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  1. <i>""In the process we are now considering it is of extreme importance, that no more time be consumed in the work of transforming the cotton into yarn than is necessary under the given social conditions. If under normal, i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour, then a day’s labour does not count as 12 hours’ labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12 b pounds of yarn; for in the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts. "</i></p>

This is a strange linguistic ontology of value. That value is determined by 'socially necessary labour time under normal, average conditions' which is broad and vague enough to not be instructive on exactly how to determine it. Value is taken as a property of what is produced that remains the same everywhere and is revealed by an esoteric calculation possibly by some vague linguistic construction and has specialized exceptions in which case it stops working. The usefulness of measurement lies in its capacity for simplicity and consistency - something that LTV seems to entirely fail at. Will a product made somewhat inefficiently have /no/ value? will it have lesser value? How is the objective value of products made in abnormal conditions measured? How can 'socially necessary' possibly be quantified and held as a common standard across time and space?

<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  2. <i>"The value of a day’s labour-power amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a day’s labour is embodied in that quantity of labour-power, i.e., because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour-power, cost half a day’s labour. But the past labour that is embodied in the labour-power, and the living labour that it can call into action; the daily cost of maintaining it, and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things. The former determines the exchange-value of the labour-power, the latter is its use-value. The fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day. Therefore, the value of labour-power, and the value which that labour-power creates in the labour-process, are two entirely different magnitudes; and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist had in view, when he was purchasing the labour-power. The useful qualities that labour-power possesses, and by virtue of which it makes yarn or boots, were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non; for in order to create value, labour must be expended in a useful manner. What really influenced him was the specific use-value which this commodity possesses of being a source not only of value, but of more value than it has itself. This is the special service that the capitalist expects from labour-power, and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the “eternal laws” of the exchange of commodities. The seller of labour-power, like the seller of any other commodity, realises its exchange-value, and parts with its use-value. He cannot take the one without giving the other. The use-value of labour-power, or in other words, labour, belongs just as little to its seller, as the use-value of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it. The owner of the money has paid the value of a day’s labour-power; his, therefore, is the use of it for a day; a day’s labour belongs to him. The circumstance, that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labour-power costs only half a day’s labour, while on the other hand the very same labour-power can work during a whole day, that consequently the value which its use during one day creates, is double what he pays for that use, this circumstance is, without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means an injury to the seller.

    Our capitalist foresaw this state of things, and that was the cause of his laughter. The labourer therefore finds, in the workshop, the means of production necessary for working, not only during six, but during twelve hours."</i></p>
So surplus value is a function of labour power having the capacity to produce more value by working the entire day despite requiring only half the amount of time to reproduce itself? Labour is a special commodity which is a source of vmore value than it has itself? If this is the correct interpretation then it seems to be the final death trap for this economic theory because marx here seems to have described an equivalent of perpetual motion machine that produces value from nothingness. A more convenient explanation for the creation of surplus value might be that the laborer is not adequately compensated for the expenditure of labour power - but adequacy is determined socially and contractually, not objectively. The notion of the laborer arriving at the workship to be surprised by terms of work involving additional hours also seems wrong considering that the worker usually has some approximate idea of the effort required before contractually agreeing to a price (which is the mutually agreed value for his labour).

Notes.

There are two outcomes in the process of production.
<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>"By the simple addition of a certain quantity of labour, new value is added, and by the quality of this added labour, the original values of the means of production are preserved in the product. This two-fold effect, resulting from the two-fold character of labour, may be traced in various phenomena. "</i></p>

1. The labourer "preserves" the former values of materials and resources used by "transforming" or causing a "transmigration" of value from the means/materials of production to the final product. If a machine costs 100$ and over a lifetime makes 50 cars then 2$ of its value was presumably preserved in each car only on the "back of labour". 

2. The labourer augments this value by adding his own labour to the product. This depends on the productiveness of the labourer relative to the "average, socially necessary time needed to produce" the product. 


2.1 The value that he preserves in the product is directly proportional to the new value that he adds to the product.
2.2 The value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour contained in it but also limited by social conditions. If the time socially necessary for the production of any commodity alters  all previously existing commodities of the same class are affected, because they are, as it were, only individuals of the species. Their value at any given time is measured by the labour socially necessary, i.e., by the labour necessary for their production under the then existing social conditions. 

There are two kinds of capital as defined by Marx:

1. Constant capital: that part of capital that does not undergo any alteration in value but is preserved (raw material, auxilliary material, instruments of labour), as argued in (1).
2. Variable capital: the part capital represented by labour power that changes in value (undergoes alteration), reproduces itself in the product and produces excess (in surplus value). 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<u><b>Remarks</b></u>

1. This seems like a rather confused way of conceptualizing value. One that requires several niche caveats, exceptions and mental contortions to accept.

2. Major violations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank">occam's razor</a>. The simplest and most intuitive explanation is usually the best one. This is neither.

3. The distinction between the labourer and the means of production is not clear to me. In what way is the value of the machine (that substitutes manual work) preserved but that of the labour "altered"? Variable capital is defined in terms of labour power that undergoes alteration but it seems not qualitatively distinct from the usual alterations and depredations of the means of production. In fact, can one not define the expenditure of labour power similarly to the expenditure of machine power? Both preserving their value in some form in the final product?

4. In what way is this value precisely calculated? If the ultimate arbitrator of value is decided by prices in the market then this analysis is moot. IF however one agrees to the objective formulae given by marx "average socially necessary time to produce something that has use-value", how exactly is this calculated? And how does one go about estimating the constant and variable capital congealed in a product?

5. HAS this been calculated for a sustainable economic region anywhere in history? Did the soviets ever rely on average socially necessary labour time to measure value and plan their economy accordingly? Did the cubans? did anyone? HAs this ever worked in the history of socialist attempts?

It might be apparent that I'm not particularly convinced by the literary gymnastics Marx uses for objectively defining "value".

It seems more elegant and correct for every individual to be the arbitrator of value defined subjectively to themselves. A watch might be more valuable to me than a clock even if they take the same time to produce manually. To someone else, depending on their need or want, the opposite might hold true. Can one not augment value by the allocation or exchange of watches/clocks for them to align more efficiently to how people describe value for themselves? A descriptive approach to value instead of a prescriptive one seems more amenable for a pluralistic and subjective population.

<b><u>Chapter 9:  The Rate of Surplus-Value</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch09.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>


Notes.


Section 1.  Defines the "degree of the exploitation of labour-power" by capital, or the labourer by the capitalist quantitatively. It is exactly equal to the rate of surplus labour over necessary labour. s/v.

So,

If c = constant capital (for materials, machines, etc)
   v = variable capital (for reproduction of labour)
   s = capital/value produced by working labour for longer than time needed to reproduce itself (10hrs instead of 6hrs - then s is value produced in the extra 4 hrs)

then the total value of the commoditie produced: T = c+v+s despite only c+v capital advanced. the surplus is s and usually profit for the capitalist. s/v is quantitative exploitation.


Section 2. Gives a numerical example of the above in terms of yarn and cotton.

Section 3. A discussion of Nassau Senior's argument that reduction of working hours by law (Factory law act) by even 1 hour will rob the factory owners of profits .
Nassau contends "Now the following analysis (!) will show that in a mill so worked, the whole net profit is derived from the last hour." and goes on to give an economic argument of costs and value produced. Marx then draws out an economic polemic in response describing how the worker reproduces his wages in the first 5.5 hours and the profit in the next 5 hours.

Section 4. Short enough to be directly quoted:

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>"The portion of the product that represents the surplus-value, (one tenth of the 20 lbs., or 2 lbs. of yarn, in the example given in Sec. 2) we call “surplus-produce.” Just as the rate of surplus-value is determined by its relation, not to the sum total of the capital, but to its variable part; in like manner, the relative quantity of surplus-produce is determined by the ratio that this produce bears, not to the remaining part of the total product, but to that part of it in which is incorporated the necessary labour. Since the production of surplus-value is the chief end and aim of capitalist production, it is clear, that the greatness of a man’s or a nation’s wealth should be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus-produce.

The sum of the necessary labour and the surplus-labour, i.e., of the periods of time during which the workman replaces the value of his labour-power, and produces the surplus-value, this sum constitutes the actual time during which he works, i.e., the working-day."</i></p>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<u><b>Remarks</b></u>

1. This chapter is notable for laying out definitions. Particularly for quantitatively describing "exploitation".

Personal Notes.

A long and detailed account of what marx describes as the civil war betweeen the two classes: the workers and the capitalists - leading from children as young as 13 starving and dying of pestilence and overwork amid phosphorous in matchstick factories in the 19th century to the enactment of several regulations that mandated more humane working hours. Marx notes that the definition of the "working day" is of paramount importance to the capitalist whose surplus value depends proportionately with the variable capital and labour he can apply to the constant capital (machines). 

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>"If the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself, he robs the capitalist."
"..the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working-day, no limit to surplus-labour. The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working-day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working-days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working-day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides. Hence is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working-day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and collective labour, i.e., the working-class. "</i></p>


There exists an inherent antimony between the worker who desires sufficient time for self actualization and personal nourishment beyond the labour needed to sustain himself and the capitalist for whom any hour in which the machine is not used leads to a potential loss in surplus value. Both attempt to exercise their right to as consumers and producers of labour power to agitate for their own definition of the working terms that remain at the center of the class struggle in the 19th century.

Section 2 contains a discussion of the petty ways in which factory oners of corvee and britain attempted to extract more labour time from their workers by flouting regulations and pilfering from time mandated to be reserved for food, rest and recuperation.
6. Agricultural workers: long hours, formation of trades union
7. Railway men: accidents from overwork, failure of labor power
8. Dressmaking (milliners): Mary Anne Walkley, 20, death from overwork.
9. Blacksmithing: die at rate of 31 per thousand/year, 11 above mean 


Section 4: Relay system

A discussion of how the capitalists of 19th century britain employed workers in two 12 hour shifts (day and night) to ensure their machines (constant capital) were used throughout 24 hours to yield maximum surplus value.

Section 5: Struggle Over Extension of Work Day

The struggle has two subjects
— capital for which "the worker is nothing other than labor-power for the duration of his whole life." Capital, with its "were-wolf hunger for surplus labor"
— the working class which seeks "time for education, for intellectual development, for the fulfillment of social functions, for social intercourse, for the free play of the vital forces of his body and his mind..."

Capital will try to use up workers' lives as fast as possible, if new recruits are available. If not, it may have them imported, e.g. from agricultural areas or poor houses by "flesh agents." True for slave labor, true for wage labor. Its treatment of labor is purely a function of profitability. This excessive using up of human life is not a question of subjective viciousness but of competition between capitalists that keeps pressure on all.
"The establishment of the normal working day is the result of centuries of struggle between the capitalist and the worker

Section 6: The attempts by both classes to win the working day conditions in their favor. Working class using the state machinery for regulation. And capitalists by skirting around it through other extraneous changes that could either skirt such laws or overturn such laws.


Section 7: Factory legislation gradually expanded to the entire industry. France followed britain. Workers were helpless and at the mercy of capitalists as individuals but far more effective when organized - capable of waging a civil class struggle.

<u><b>Notable excerpts</b></u>

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>
Working class: Began to resist: "As soon as the working class, . . . had recovered its senses . . . it began to offer resistance, first of all in England the native land of large-scale industry."

    1802 - 1833 Five labor laws are passed in response to working class struggle
    —but there is no enforcement
    —children and young people are worked all night, all day or both

    1833: The Factory Act of 1833 is passed, will last till 1844
    —applied to cotton, wool, flax & silk factories
    —regulated hours of children and young people
    —set working day at 15 hrs (5:30 - 8:30)
    —set maximum hours at 12 (during this 15 hr period)
    —set minimum meal times of 1 1/2 hrs
    —no children under 9 yrs (mostly)
    —set maximum hours of children 9 - 13 yrs at 8 hrs
        (except in silk industry with 10 hrs)
    —banned night work for ages 9 - 18
    —no regulation of adult workers over 18 yrs, could work 15hrs 

Capital: the capitalist response was to find new ways to lengthen hours

    —mainly the development of the relay system
    —ages 9-13 worked in two shifts (5:30-1:30; 1:30-8:30)
    —made it hard to judge compliance with law
    —sought to lower age of childhood from 13 to 12 —this was defeated by working class:
    —"'the pressure from without' became more threatening"
    —sought to repeal corn laws to lower wages 

Working Class: during this period workers began to demand the Ten Hours Bill, achieved:

    1844: Factory Act of 7 June 1844
    —protected women workers over 18
    —by limiting hours to 12
    —by banning night work
    —reduced hours for children under 13 to max. 6 1/2 hrs
    —except silk which got 10hrs for 10-13 yr olds
    —attacked the relay system (a main object of the law)
    —all labor must end at same time
    —labor time regulated with public clocks
    —hrs to be posted
    —still no regulation of hours of adult male workers
    —The results of this was the generalization of the working day to 12 hrs

    1847: Factory Act of 8 June 1847 (10 Hours Act)
    —reduced hours for young persons (13 - 18) and all women to 11 hours
    —hours to be reduced to 10 on 1 May 1848
    —still no regulation of hours of adult male workers

    1848: Revolutions of 1848 swept Europe 

Capital: the capitalist response to these laws included:

    —use of crisis of 1846-47 to repeal corn laws, proclaim free trade
    —reduce wages (about 25%)
    —attempt to get workers to demand repeal of Act of 1847 (failed)
    —attack on factory inspectors (failed)
    —counterattack against working class in wake of uprisings of 1848
    —dismissals of young people and women (regulated hours)
    —restored night work for adult males
    —shifted meal times to before and after work (failed, courts ordered otherwise)
    —reorganized "relay system"
    —divided up hours into "shreds of time" (p.403)
    —kept workers in factory longer than work hours
    —"hours of enforced idleness" (paid 10 hr wages for control over 12-15hrs)
    —Home Secretary George Gray told factory inspectors to lay off
    —local courts acquitted mill-owners of violations of Act
    —1850: Court of the Exchequer ruled Act of 1844 was meaningless 

Working Class: Against these counterattacks, the workers struggled harder:

    "So, far, the workers had offered a resistance which was passive, though inflexible and unceasing. They now protested in Lancashire and Yorkshire in threatening meetings . . . class antagonisms had reached an unheard-of degree of tension."

    1850: The Factory Act of 5 August 1850
    —ended the relay system
    —set work day at 6am to 6pm (except for children:attack on adults)
    —set 1.5 hrs for mealtime, same time for all
    —but allowed increase in hours of young and women from 10-10.5 M-F, reduced to 7.5 on Saturday
    —silk again the exception, children 10--13 could still be worked 10.5 in some branches.

    1853: a law was passed limiting time children could be kept at work to 6am to 6pm
    —forced by adult males who didn't want children used against them
    —cumulative result was to achieve 12 hr day for all, including adult males
    —result: "physical and moral regeneration of the factory workers"

<b><u>Chapter 11: Rate and Mass of Surplus Value</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch11.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>


Painstakingly etches three "laws".

1. Mass of surplus value: Sm = Vt * (s/v) 
   where Vt = number of workers. But also total variable capital? I suppose the intention is to multiply the produce of one labourer with however many labourers the capital the capitalist can afford. 
   But then conflating it with capital seems unnecessary and mathematically unsound.

2. Absolute limit in working day (an arbitrary unit of time likely relevant because workers are paid "per day") to 24 hours limits the surplus value extractible in a day. Therefore other means are necessary for the capitalist to increase surplus value (reducing workers, making them work longer hours)

3.  The mass of surplus value varies directly with the investment in variable capital. The more labourers the employer can put to work on more material, the more his profits are multiplied. (keeping s/v constant)


<u><b>Remarks</b></u>

1. More dated economics. Neither of these measures are used for measuring worker productivity anymore. It's worthwhile to note that with the cap of 8hrs/day in most countries, capitalists hope to employ increasingly efficient and skilled workers instead of those who are willing to work longer hours. Maybe that's driving the spurt in higher education now?
