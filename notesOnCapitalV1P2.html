I see the chapter essentially posing three constructions that conclude into a final argument(4):

1. The commensurability and exchangeability of different commodities becomes possible only by virtue of a common social substance that is congealed in each - Labor - abstract human labor that describes all the varied particular specialized labor that goes into different types of commodities. Such labor is the measure of value because it transforms natural material for use making the object/thing a use value. When it is exchanged by one agent/individual/group for another individual's object - both of which serving human needs/wants that go beyond those of the laborer, it becomes a commodity that expresses the value of the labor in it through exchange value. This expression gives the appearance of a relation between commodities that is social.


<b><u>Noteworthy excerpts and important questions for the left:</u></b>
<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  1. <i>"The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,”[1] its unit being a single commodity.A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference."</i>
</p> Assumptions in terminology: capitalism. Does it make no difference if the desire is that of an essential necessity compared to a fanciful want? "From each according to his ability, to each according to his <i>need</i>"?


This chapter is dense. A crash course in LTV, commodity fetishism, social production, commodity exchange, religion and most importantly - dialectics.
