META: I've added timestamps to approximately describe the time when I held an ideology: so that I in my present self can distance myself from it at will. What I think and believe today might be discarded and found inadequate tomorrow. A heraclitean flux of reflections that need to be constantly situated in a larger whole. This meta itself was written on 23/09/2019 and might change later. I will be different later (I hope).

* I am no emperor keeping a journal. Currently I'm reading on the visceral disgust felt by Sartre's existentialist protagonist on confronting his existence as a solipsistic asocial ahistorical crystal. Reject plato. Reject Sartre. Situate yourself as an amalgam of historica social linguistic ideology. Fuck that's a lot of abstraction with no material specificity. For more tangible descriptions: check back in later. Existentialism has been the bane of my youth.
