<b><u>Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch04.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>
<br><br>
This chapter chiefly distinguishes between two types of commerce: purchasing a commodity for consumption and purchasing a commodity for resale with the intention of augmenting the amount of money owned.<br><br>

My synopsis.<br><br>

1. World embracing commerce can be traced back to the 16th century. Money is the final product of the circulation of commodities and the first form in which capital appears.<br><br>

2. In the circulation of commodities there exist two types of circuits.<br><br>
2.1 The first: C-M-C. In which one commodity is sold first to acquire money. And the money acquired is used to purchase a different commodity which finally exits circulation through consumption.<br><br>
2.2 The second: M-C-M. In which a commodity is purchased with the explicit purpose of resale. Since selling the commodity again at the same value would be absurd and purposeless, it is typically done so with the intention of augmenting money. i.e the form more accurately is M-C-M' where M'=M+d where the original sum is "advanced" with an added increment called surplus value. Such increment in value might be purely accidental in C-M-C trades but intentional in M-C-M trrades. Money that circulates in the latter manner (with the explicit purpose of augmentation) is thereby transformed into, becomes capital, and is already potentially capital.<br><br>

3. The conscious representative of this movement, the possessor of money becomes a capitalist. His person, or rather his pocket, is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns. The expansion of value is the capitalist's subjective aim. Even profit from a single transaction does not suffice for the capitalist's contentment since the capitalist seeks for boundless, infinite expansion in value.<br><br>

4. "M-C-M' is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation."<br><br>

<b><u>Noteworthy excerpts and important questions:</u></b>

Is there really that significant a difference between purchase of a commodity for consumption compared to its purchase for further exchange? Marx initially asserts that money is just the universal equivalent form of commodities. Aren't commodities often sought by an individual so that they may explicitly used for further prosperity, eg purchasing a tool for making production easier. What about commodities that are sold at a later date when its use to the owner has been subsided and needs to be dispensed with (refurbished or second hand goods). Such goods/commodities are sold at a price that's often lower than that of the initial purchase and is initiated without any intent towards "greedy" desires for infinite expansion of value but out of pragmatic exchanges between two consenting adults. Is the seller of a refurbished good, a capitalist too? Is a capitalist defined by caricature of greed that seeks infinite expansion of profit without social context? Is the description of circulation commodities through the abstraction of "M-C-M" and "C-M-C" "circuits" adequate? Moreover, are they even particularly distinct considering money and labor are equivalent expressions of value determined by labor and differ only in form?<br><br>

There's a very distinct method of reasoning used in the four chapters so far. It's the dialectical method. My intuitions of how to think and reason using deduction and description of objects and their appropriation by people is vastly distinct from those that underscore the dialectical method. This makes it considerably difficult for me to grasp abstruse statements that one cannot remark on unless firmly embedded in said tradition of thinking. The description of differing conceptual forms of commodities and money i find largely superfluous. But perhaps macro models require special terminology to abstract and describe laws. But "greedy capitalist" hardly seems the kind of special terminology that would yield a theoretical model of much use considering it essentializes a particular aspect of economic behavior without situating it in economic or historical use.

  2. <i>“When a thing is bought in order to be sold again, the sum employed is called money advanced; when it is bought not to be sold, it may be said to be expended.”</i></p><p class="quote">
  3. <i>"Aristotle opposes Oeconomic to Chrematistic. He starts from the former. So far as it is the art of gaining a livelihood, it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence, and useful either to a household or the state. “True wealth (o aleqinos ploutos) consists of such values in use; for the quantity of possessions of this kind, capable of making life pleasant, is not unlimited. There is, however, a second mode of acquiring things, to which we may by preference and with correctness give the name of Chrematistic, and in this case there appear to be no limits to riches and possessions. Trade (e kapelike is literally retail trade, and Aristotle takes this kind because in it values in use predominate) does not in its nature belong to Chrematistic, for here the exchange has reference only to what is necessary to themselves (the buyer or seller).” Therefore, as he goes on to show, the original form of trade was barter, but with the extension of the latter, there arose the necessity for money. On the discovery of money, barter of necessity developed into kapelike, into trading in commodities, and this again, in opposition to its original tendency, grew into Chrematistic, into the art of making money. Now Chrematistic is distinguishable from Oeconomic in this way, that “in the case of Chrematistic circulation is the source of riches poietike crematon ... dia chrematon diaboles. And it appears to revolve about money, for money is the beginning and end of this kind of exchange (to nomisma stoic eion tes allages estin). Therefore also riches, such as Chrematistic strives for, are unlimited. Just as every art that is not a means to an end, but an end in itself, has no limit to its aims, because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to that end, while those arts that pursue means to an end, are not boundless, since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them, so with Chrematistic, there are no bounds to its aims, these aims being absolute wealth. Oeconomic not Chrematistic has a limit ... the object of the former is something different from money, of the latter the augmentation of money.... By confounding these two forms, which overlap each other, some people have been led to look upon the preservation and increase of money ad infinitum as the end and aim of Oeconomic.” (Aristoteles, De Rep. edit. Bekker, lib. l.c. 8, 9. passim.)"</i></p>Surely neither Aristotle and Marx have envisaged infinite wealth. Or a measure of wealth which cannot be imagined to have specific social use? One thinks of the colossal amount of wealth owned by current billionaires but is it beyond imagination that it may find its use in spurring production over several generations if adequately distributed?

Largely unremarkable chapter with dated economic modeling and language.<br><br>

<b><u>Chapter Five: Contradictions in the General Formula of Capital</u></b><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch05.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a><br><br>

This chapter describes the contradictions that arise in the general formula of capital M-C-M' (money-commodity-more money). The first contradiction is that both parties in an exchange cannot simultaneously gain surplus value from the exchange of equivalents.<br><br>

2. Behind all attempts to represent the circulation of commodities as a source of surplus-value, there lurks a quid pro quo, a mixing up of use-value and exchange-value.<br><br>

Circulation or exchange of commodities begets no value.

Therefore, capital cannot originate in circulation, and it is equally impossible for it to originate apart from circulation. It must have its origin both in circulation and not in circulation.<br><br>

This is resolved in the next chapter.<br><br>

<b><u>Chapter Six: The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power</u></b><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a><br><br>

The change in the value of money that converts it into capital cannot take place in the money itself.<br>
It must, therefore, take its rise in the commodity bought by the first act of circulation; but not in its value, for equivalents are exchanged, and the commodity is paid for at its full value.<br>

This increment or excess over the original value I call "surplus-value."<br>

For labour-power to be available for consumption in the market, some prerequisites are mandatory:<br>

1. The labourer must be free to sell his labour-power and must have no other commodity for sale.<br><br>
2. He must be free from the means of producing his own means of subsistence.<br>
3. He must be compelled to sell his labour-power.<br>

The value of labour-power is determined by:<br>
1. The value of the necessaries required to produce, develop, maintain, and perpetuate the labourer.<br>
2. The value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer.<br>
3. The value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer's family.<br>
4. The cost of developing that labour-power by education and training.<br>

The capitalist advances the means of subsistence to the labourer in the form of money.<br>
The labourer advances his labour to the capitalist before he receives payment.<br>
The labourer everywhere works a certain time gratis for the capitalist.<br>
The wage-form extinguishes every trace of the division of the working-day into necessary labour and surplus-labour.<br>

The value of labour-power, and the value which that labour-power creates in the labour-process, are two entirely different magnitudes.<br>

This chapter is the most politically and economically significant piece of text I've read in a long time. It establishes the value of man qua labourer, of the economic function of children as substitutes for their parents in replenishing labour-power, the conditions that compel a person to sell labour-power instead of the commodity it can produce that involve qualitative deprivation of resources compared to the capitalist, the description of a capitalist as the temporary owner of the commodity of labour-power and the entity to which the labourer advances credit even under significant duress, the problems posed by the separation by intervals of time between exercise of labour power and its actual payment, and the source of surplus value in the exercise of labour-power itself.<br><br>

There exist ofcourse concerns with LTV, but accepting its premises has already yielded some significant political and economic results.<br><br>

  <i>-"The consumption of labour-power is at one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplus-value. The consumption of labour-power is completed, as in the case of every other commodity, outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation.</i></p>
<p class="quote">
  <i>-[c1] "Hence legislation in various countries fixes a maximum for labour-contracts. Wherever free labour is the rule, the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract. In some States, particularly in Mexico (before the American Civil War, also in the territories taken from Mexico, and also, as a matter of fact, in the Danubian provinces till the revolution effected by Kusa), slavery is hidden under the form of peonage. By means of advances, repayable in labour, which are handed down from generation to generation,1. The labourer must be free to sell his labour-power and must have no other commodity for sale.<br><br>
2. He must be free from the means of producing his own means of subsistence.<br>
3. He must be compelled to sell his labour-power.<br>

4. The cost of developing that labour-power by education and training.<br>

* The system of commercial credit had to start at the moment when the labourer, the prime creator of products, could, thanks to his savings, wait for his wages until the end of the week."<br><br>
