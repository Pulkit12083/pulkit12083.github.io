Annie's first step in utopia mesmerized her enough to stop her from taking the second. For the first time, she stood in a new world with true abundance. From her vantage point on top of a cliff she saw a vast expanse of land as yet unconquered by members of another civilization or her own. She saw a swollen river thundering through a forest of giant trees filled with ripe fruit dotting their branches and coloring the ground beneath them as they fell, turned into pulp on impact and became visited by strange and placid herbivores seemingly void of any adaptations that might imply a competitive inter-species struggle for survival. The wind blew through the forest in one uniform direction, as if propelled by a singular robust force infusing the place with vitality unhindered by pestilence or any consumptive existence. Each time it did, the entire forest swayed and bent in one direction causing a wave of fruits to fall and roll with the wind. Annie turned her eye upward and saw the sky enveloped by sheets of clouds that moved like bedsheets hanging out to dry, uniformly illuminating the ground beneath it with a soft purple dayglow, and dispersing a soft drizzle with each wave rolling across the sky. The sounds emanating from the forest could only be described as a vague mix between Grouper's ambient album from titled "alien observer", which comprised of long soft notes from an electronic xylophone and arthur russell's "world of echo" that stretched out dirty chords played on the violin the way a curious child might play with an instrument to draw the attention of a bored kitten. 

The scents of this new place were surprisingly familiar to her - but where they came from remained a mystery. The air smelt of patchouli at one point but as soon as the wind changed direction she instead identified oud combined with a smell that faintly reminded her of a childhood visit to the fruit market with her grandfather when she first naively conceptualized the idea of a scarcity-free abode. She could also smell Pako, the person she had come with, even though he had now drifted off into the distance and was already making his way through the herbivores to catch some fruit - most likely to bring back to her. Why she could smell him from such a distance remained unclear but it somehow made perfect sense that she could. She guessed that if she spoke his name out loud, even if in a whisper, the wind would carry it to exactly where he was standing with its tone, all its inflections and annoyance at him for having immediately and carelesly thrown himself into a newer situation with unjustified bravado and recklessness.

Annie does not recall how long it took her to grok the fullness of her first impressions here. She didn't want to bring a watch and have newer experiences measured by metrics from the older world. Besides, she wouldn't know how and why to use it. She tapped her thumb on her palm to get a consistent rhythm by which she could measure the pace of life here but each time she tapped she'd forget how long it had been since the previous one. She tried to count the number of pink fruits falling in the interval between two blinks of her eyes and by the second blink she'd forget the exact count - which could range from five to five million. This engendered her first worry in utopia. She could not ascertain how long it had been since she stood in it. She decided to let hunger and sleep dictate the cadence for her existence here. And immediately after this decision, she realized she could not recall when she last ate, or slept, or anything from her past. She tried to trace a continuous thread beginning from the present, weaving through whatever experiences she could recollect backward in time but she could make no headway. This disturbed her tremendously. She took her gaze away from the captivating forest and fixed it on the ground hoping to recall something, anything outside the dimension she was currently in. After failing to recollect even the purpose of her visit here, she decided to visit the forest later and began to walk in the opposite direction hoping to find some clues. The shimmering sea of blue petals would part respectfully for her flip flops as she trotted up along leaving pako to his solipsistic shenanigans behind. Sooner, or later, not that annie could tell the difference between the two, she encountered a tree with an old man in a harris tweed jacket and jute pants standing beneath it. He seemed to be muttering something to himself unconcerend with the fact that a violet, semi squashed fruit rested on his bald head that was attracting orange fruitflies lazily circling above it.

"Quite the fashionable hat you've got there Sir", Annie exclaimed to him. He looked at her and began to speak in a lingo that behooved her more than Gayatri Spivak's books on postcolonial subaltern theory. Determined not to expend any more time on abstruse academecians, children of kant, and intellectuals in such a place, she decided to leave the fruity oldie and venture on forward. Partly because she was certain that pako would inevitably find him and in his usual misguided hope to extract some meaning where there was none, engage with the old man until he could extract the essence of his ramblings and tell her about them regardless of her interest.  

She eventually came across a second tree, exactly like the first, but this time with an old corporeally hollow old lady who was taking off her organs from the clothes line and assembling them back into herself one by one. Annie commented out loud "feeling rather empty today are we Miss" and the lady remarked "yeah, sometimes i feel like i put myself out there too much and it just seems like one of those days when one feels one ought to regroup ya know". Annie nodded, pretending to understand and then continued onward hoping to entirely forget she'd just seen a human with their innards out on display on a new planet like a bored suburban housewife hosting a yard sale on casual sunday. An actual yard sale, Annie did soon encounter next to a multistoreyed building with an ikea art deco hotel facade but no board demonstrating its name or purpose. The items on sale didn't interest her much- a chandelier, silver candlesticks, a yacht, vintage NBA cards, a gold plated macbook, and shiny chrome tchotchkes. The concierge hosting the yard sale followed her to the elevator and asked "which floor ma'am". Annie shrugged, and the concierge with a knowing smile said "certainly" and pressed one of the 80 buttons on the panel inside the glass box. 

The elevator doors opened on several floors, all revealing the same opulent scene with people dressed in lush furred dresses - presumably made from the hides of the herbivores annie saw before, walking and chatting with each other about seemingly nothing in particular. At one point a group of ladies walked in the elevator box and waited for the concierge to ask them "which floor madame?". They looked at each other in confusion, and the concierge smiled knowingly again and pressed another button which took them to a floor similar to the previous one where he herded the confused group out to continue chatting and walking beneath a plethora of chandeliers. Eventually, a sarkari karamchari in khakis walked in, spat his paan in the corner below the panel with buttons, fingered his ear to remove some fluff, inspected it and flicked it away until it landed on one of the self cleaning mirrored walls of the elevator. The elevator took the annie, polite concierge, and the sarkari karamchari with questionable hygiene to an unknown floor and finally stopped. 

As the door opened, the concierge spoke out "It's time for you survey ma'am."

"What survey?" - asked Annie.
"Why ofcourse, the exclusive-priveleged-members-club-experience survey ma'am" - the concierge replied. 

"Exclusiwhaaat" - annie's confusion trailed off into the unexpected sight of several hundred bureaucrats and advertising agents working together in what seemed like a very busy office distributing questionaires and guiding visitors through a protracted survey process. The sarkari karamchari took out a sheet of paper and a pencil from his pocket, and walked to his desk, gesturing her to come along. He asked her to take a seat and began his inquiry.  

 "Q.1 On a scale of 1 to 10 rate your experience of BATA excelsior flip flops in guiding you through the Corlandia. A rating of 1 signifying  minimal comfort and no recommendation and a rating of 10 signifying  maximal comfort in traversal and definite recommendation."

 "ummm....recommendation to whom" - annie muttered.

 The karamchari ticked something on the form and continued..
"Q2. On a scale of 1 to 10 rate your experience of Nestle's GMO fruit  forest farm. 1 indicating inedible and unsavory fruits and 10  indicating the fruits tasted like the nectar of the gods driving you into fits of ecstatic pleasure."   

 "I didn't get to taste any" - Annie said bitterly. 

The karamchari chose an option on the form and continued.
"Q3. On a scale of 1 to 10 rate your experience of Warner music group's ambient extraterrestrial-forest-themed album mix playing through the forest"

"How did I get here? How can I leave?" Annie asked worriedly.

The karamchari ignored her question and continued: "Q4. Did you experience any side effects through our exclusive  premium member's only diamond subscription BATA adventureland - such as  memory loss, inability to focus or tell time, and or feeling a bottomless pit of purposelessness at any point?"

 "All of them actually" - Annie responded somewhat indignantly.


The karamchari proceeded to his next question which intended to guage her rating of the sky holograms sponsored by Universal studios but by  then Annie had already left his desk and was looking out the giant glass window to the field outside as the machines responsible for constructing the elaborate mirage wound down and revealed instead a decrepit, dusty and barren wasteland interspersed with pockets of concrete buildings huddled together beneath a stormy and polluted sky. Annie ran back to the desk and asked the karamchari about the woman  with her organs out and the babbling old man. "Oh you mean, the original architects of Corlandia. The adam and eve of our proverbial paradise. We try not to think too much about them."
