Most modern bureaucracies identify me with the name Pulkit Manocha. But more often, I'm called Pulkit.

What am I?

- An amorphous philistine philandering with philosophy, code, political theory, algorithms, software, and confusion.
- A bundle of questions and doubts that emerge from a critical rejection of conventional social norms and institutions.
- A fusion of influences, some of which cited and discussed on this website. 

What am I?

- Not an instantiation of a platonic abstraction. Not a "software engineer", "man", "son", "_ist", or "_ian". 
- Not solely a consumer. Not what clothes I wear, what films I watch, what objects I purchase. 
- Not a solipsist. Not a singular cartesian entity emerging from vacuum. 

What do I currently care about?

- Understanding illness and adaptations to defeat the limitations of physical pain
- Crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- Imagining an admirable life eschewing every <a href="bourgeoisinjunctions.html">bourgeois injunction</a>
- Understanding violence, particularly its systemic manifestations.
- The politics of contentment socially contingent upon the suffering of another.
- Division of labour and what it means for my social existence. 
- Eschewing conventional notions of machismo (<a href="morefemme.jpg" target="_blank">aesthetic</a> and behavioral)
