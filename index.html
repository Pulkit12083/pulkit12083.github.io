.. a teetering bulb of alienated dread and utopian dream ..
===========================================================
?Pulkit?: An amorphous floating philistine philandering with philosophy, politics and confusion.



What am I? 
Eschewing pointless platonic categories.
Eschewing unhelpful consumptive descriptors.
Eschewing solipsistic delusions.
Esperar?: a fusion of every person that left their mark. 

<a href="manifesto.html">This is my manifesto.</a>


Currently I care about:
- the question of why i get to sleep under a roof while another starves on the road
- crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- imagining an admirable figure despite every damned bourgeois injunction
- fostering radical empathy
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2721267493?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">the language of John Berger</a>
- you. tell me about the conditions of your life.
- the question of <a href="violencia.jpg">violence</a>
- godard and tati: and how they make me feel free
- why i am expected to feel content while my luxury is contingent upon the material suffering of another
- division of labour and what it means for my social existence

Nothing is settled. Except the imperfection of the analogy. For everything else I have questions. 

============================================================
Pulkit Manocha: But why does the author name matter? Really. 
I don't care about private property.
All I've ever wanted is to understand.
And to foster every moment with the weight of emotion too much to bear.
