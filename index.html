.. a teetering bulb of alienated dread and utopian dream ..
===========================================================
?Pulkit?: An amorphous floating philistine philandering with philosophy and confusion.



What am I? 
Eschewing pointless platonic categories.
Eschewing pointless consumptive descriptors.
Eschewing solipsistic delusions.
Esperar?: a fusion of every person that left their mark. 



Currently I care about:
- why i get to sleep under a roof while another starves on the road
- crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- imagining an admirable figure despite every damned bourgeois injunction
- fostering radical empathy
- the language of John Berger
- you. tell me about you.


Please send help.
And books. I like to read and listen.

Nothing is settled. Except the imperfection of the analogy.

============================================================
Pulkit Manocha: But why does the author name matter? Really. 
I don't care about private property.
All I've ever wanted is to understand.




Sometimes I'm here: pulkit12083@iiitd.ac.in
And sometimes here: pmanocha@usc.edu
And sometimes away.
