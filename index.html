<b>.. a teetering bulb of alienated dread and utopian dream ..</b>
===========================================================
<a href="perchedonatree.jpeg" target="_blank">?Pulkit?:</a> An amorphous floating philistine philandering with philosophy, politics and <a href="suchdoubts.mp4"  target="_blank">confusion</a>.



What am *I*?
Eschewing pointless platonic categories     : Not a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulkit-manocha-63a071126/" target="_blank">"software engineer"</a>, "man", "son". Not an abstraction.
Eschewing unhelpful consumptive descriptors : Not what clothes i wear, what films i watch, what objects i purchase.
Eschewing solipsistic delusions             : Not a singular cartesian entity emerging from vacuum.
Esperar?: a fusion of every person that left their mark.

Currently I care about:
- understanding illness and adaptations to defeat the limitations of physical pain
- crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- imagining an admirable figure despite every damned <a href="bourgeoisinjunctions.html">bourgeois injunction</a>
- fostering radical empathy
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2721267493?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1" target="_blank">the language of John Berger</a>
- you. tell me about the conditions of your life. what do you care for sincerely. what do you consider important.
- understanding <a href="violencia.jpg" target="_blank">violence</a>
- why i am expected to feel content while my luxury is contingent upon the material suffering of another. 
- how is it that we've made peace with sleeping in vast bedrooms while another starves on the road.
- division of labour and what it means for my social existence
- eschewing conventional notions of machismo (<a href="morefemme.jpg" target="_blank">aesthetic</a> and behavioral)

<a href="manifesto.html" target="blank">A tentative manifesto</a>
<del>Nothing is settled. Except the imperfection of the analogy. For everything else</del> I have questions.

They call me Pulkit Manocha; but why does the author's name matter? 
Last I checked the author lay dead and names identified caste or guilds.
I don't care about private property. I abhor hierarchies of power.
All I've ever wanted is to understand. 

Sometimes I'm here: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42408230-pulkit" target="_top">flipping pages</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="flippantthoughts.html">spamming flippant thoughts</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="appealdekropotkin.html" target="_blank">An appeal to the young; as felt in my heart and articulated by Kropotkin over a century ago</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/schopie" target="_blank">tracking music</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="museum.html">maintaining a running thread of images I admire</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="recipes.html">taking notes to improve my culinary library</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="https://t.me/beguiledmoonchild" target="_top">im:beguiledmoonchild talking, friterring and thinking</a>
And sometimes here: <a href="https://pulkit12083.github.io/">Reading emails: pulkit12083 [at] iiitd.ac.in  pmanocha [at] usc.edu</a>
And sometimes away.
