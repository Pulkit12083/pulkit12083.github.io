===========================================================
?Pulkit?: An amorphous floating philistine philandering with philosophy, politics and confusion.



What am I? 
Eschewing pointless platonic categories.
Eschewing pointless consumptive descriptors.
Eschewing solipsistic delusions.
Esperar?: a fusion of every person that left their mark. 



Currently I care about:
- why i get to sleep under a roof while another starves on the road
- crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- imagining an admirable figure despite every damned bourgeois injunction
- fostering radical empathy
- the language of John Berger
- understanding everything and everyone
- you. tell me about the conditions of your life.


Nothing is settled. Except the imperfection of the analogy.

Pulkit Manocha: But why does the author name matter? Really. 
I don't care about private property.
All I've ever wanted is to understand.
