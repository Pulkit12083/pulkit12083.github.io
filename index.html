Pulkit: An amorphous floating philistine philandering with philosophy and confusion.

What am I? 
Eschewing pointless platonic categories.
Eschewing pointless consumptive descriptors.

Currently I care about:
- why i get to go buy books and food and sleep under a roof while another starves on the road
- crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- fostering radical empathy
- John Berger
- you
- learning what it means to be an admirable person when
--- everything
--- around me
--- wants me
--- to make 
--- money.

Please send help.
And books. 

Nothing is settled.
