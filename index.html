    <h2 >a teetering bulb
      of alienated dread
      and utopian dream
      of the conquest of bread
      not a postmodern meme
      of confusion and fear
      awkward and sincere 
      earnest and unironic
      not detached or sardonic

  Most modern bureaucracies identify me with the name Pulkit Manocha.
  But more often, I'm called Pulkit.<hr>

What am I?

- An amorphous philistine philandering with philosophy, code, political theory, algorithms, software, and confusion.
- A bundle of questions and doubts that emerge from a critical rejection of conventional social norms and institutions.
- A fusion of influences, some of which cited and discussed on this website. 

What am I not?

- Not an instantiation of a platonic abstraction. Not a "software engineer", "man", "son", "_ist", or "_ian". 
- Not solely a consumer. Not what clothes I wear, what films I watch, what objects I purchase. 
- Not a solipsist. Not a singular cartesian entity emerging from vacuum. 
  
What do I currently care (and write) about?

- Writing better programs and solving interesting algorithmic problems.
- Crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- Imagining a life more meaningful than one dictated by <a href="bourgeoisinjunctions.html">bourgeois injunctions</a>
- Understanding violence, particularly its systemic manifestations.
- The politics of contentment socially contingent upon the suffering of another.
- Division of labour and what it means for my social existence. 
- Eschewing conventional notions of machismo (<a href="img_made/morefemme.jpg" target="_blank">aesthetic</a> and behavioral)
