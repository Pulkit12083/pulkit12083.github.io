Address to residents, city council members and mayor of Culver city 24/09/2019 to appeal for a homeless shelter instead of allowing a private museum to expand to serve its wealthy corporate patrons. Shortened from 3 minutes to 1 on the fly (leaving out entirely the last section and the bits that talk about social responsibility)

Hello,

I here to speak to you about the possibility of action that can address the distressing issue of a lack of shelter for over 270+ people who sleep outside in culver city. Over a hundred sleep on the pavement, in tents or makeshift shelters. This count is expected to rise. The grievousness of a social issue that subjects one to the indignities and suffering that homelessness does requires no introduction. So I will instead focus on what can be done: locally.

I believe (as I'm sure many others do) that this provides the city an avenue to make a step forward in its attempt to tackle homelessness - either by using this property as a space for transitional housing, a homeless shelter, or even just "affordable" housing for extremely low income families. These spaces can help provide sanitation facilities, syringe exchanges and basic services that can act as a starting point for some to begin finding a footing from which they discover long term solutions for a roof. It can also provide a space for residents of Culver city to come together and volunteer - developing a political understanding of the causes of homelessness, and a community consciousness that makes them understand the responsibilities on which our colletive progress is contingent. No museum can provide this instruction. And no community event is as deeply a matter of community than one of its own social upliftment out of scarcity of basic material needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some further notes/arguments:

* Feasibility: I learned the previous budget to address the issue was $1,345,000 and with the adequate outreach programs, this space can feasibly become an example for how a city like culver city (home to several corporate offices and a high income population) can use its material abundance to effectively begin addressing this disturbing problem. Instead of

* Alternate proposals: Some tentative proposals for it included the expansion of the Wende museum which represents a host of patrons with private interests. Having frequented the museum regularly and noted carefully its structure, size and footfall, it appears to me that the museum has far more space than it needs to entertain the few people that visit it during weekdays at any given time and a minor temporary surge in visitors during weekends when it hosts some events - all of whom the museum has accommodated extremely easily in a fraction of its space and all of who have homes to return to. The museum already has an enormous space which I believe it can use far more efficiently for its ends or whatever ambiguous community needs it claims to serve in the future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, I do not know how one could make a reasonable, conscientious, pragmatic argument for using the space for anything other than the most critical and urgent issue of tackling homelessness. It is a matter both of addressing a crisis and addressing the community needs efficiently. Perhaps with a shelter/transitional-housing we can achieve both the alleviation of one's suffering and the desires of people to look at it in a museum painting next door, wine glasses in hand.
