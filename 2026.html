    well this year begins with being positively fucked.


<hr>    


    <p>
humiliating are often the defeats and pains of life. here's one that i
endured quite recently .

    <p>
aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH



    <hr>

    <p> Thank you by Dido is such a beautiful song. I generally don't
    like pop music because of its formulaic and cliche melodies,
    things done to death, and because of my own personal tendency to
    be interested in and lured more by things that are weird,
    different, niche. But there's something about this particular song
    that I find just really nice. It's comforting to me and i don't
      mind publicly professing my feelings of love for it.
      </p>

    <p>
Her voice is sweet. and she sings about how comforting and helpful it
is for her to be around the person she's singing about. her life is
difficult and the weather is grey, but it's okay because she has this
person's picture on her wall. she's running late for work and all the
coworkers might imply that she'd get fired soon, but then she gets a
call from the person she's singing about and it all feels not that bad
after all. She then sings a "thank you" for them for giving her the
best day of her life. It's so sweet. And I think I find it so because
I can somewhat relate to it ~ having known someone who I miss and who
made a lot of my days meaningful and precious even though they would
have otherwise been bad. There are times when I want to sing this song
out of love and care for her (the person in my life, not Dido (or
maybe even Dido, for writing and singing this song and thereby helping
me recognize this feeling and express it)).
    </p>

    <p>
The song is comforting to me in other ways too - the melodious flute
and gentle guitar strumming. And it has the general soft musical
aesthetic of a relaxed 90s song that i find very comforting. I don't
remember how i discovered it but it has grown on me since i did.
    </p>

    <p>
There's something interesting about its music video however. when I
first saw it, I was a little perplexed. It shows Dido in a nice pink
colored house, looking into the camera calmly and singing, while there
are stern-faced officials who have come to evict her, and who then
barge into the house to repossess all of her possessions inside it!
All while she's singing about this person who has helped add meaning
and goodness to her life! She's really calm through it all too -
looking into the camera with an expression that i cannot tell if is a
little sad or a little grateful. Maybe it is both. Maybe it is better
for this to remain ambiguous. It is a little bit confusing however to
see her remain so composed and sing about a loved one while getting
removed from her beautiful home. Is this okay? Is this a form of love
that's reasonable and healthy? When I was in a relationship, I always
thought about how it was important that it be a positive force in our
lives and to not forget that other aspects of life (outside the
relationship) were important and meaningful too. It felt important to
remember to take care of ourselves (by our I mean me and my
partner). It would be a little melancholic to see love blind us and
inadvertently become to our detriment, coloring the relationship in
shades that are gray and sad - introducing mixed feelings to something
that felt so vibrant, beautiful, and life-affirming. I wonder if
that's how Dido feels about her life as her beautiful house is getting
taken apart from around her, as the flowers in her garden get trampled
by boots and a bulldozer, and she's forcibly taken out to the
street. The closest thing she sings about the situation occurring in
the video is:
    </p>

    <p>
"And even if my house falls down now,<br>
I wouldn't have a clue,<br>
Because you're near me.."<br>
    </p>

    
Wouldn't it be really sad and tragic to see one's house and everything
in it fall down? And not be able to even recognize it from happening
because one is so taken by someone else.. Or is it a very touching and
beautiful thing? - to be part of a love so affirming and nice that the
travesties in life don't even register or matter that much. I don't
know. When I first saw the video i wondered if it was secretly a song
about the tragicness of the blinding ability of love and how it can
bring about one's downfall - and I thought this while I was actually
doing well in life and in a relationship! But there are days when I
think that Dido sang this song very sincerely and meant it without any
irony and the lyrics are very heartfelt - and I think this while I am
doing terrible in life, having had a downfall, and am not in a
relationship anymore! Hah. The tipsy-turvy nature of things. It would
make more sense if my perception of the video was more aligned by my
personal circumstances at the time of seeing it, but they're somehow
the exact opposite lol.
    </p>

The next few lyrics in the song are:
    <p>
      
"And I want to thank you
<br>For giving me the best day of my life
<br>Oh, just to be with you,
<br>is having the best day of my life"
</p>

<p>
and as she sings, I think I truly understand what she means because
I've felt this way about someone too and genuinely feel so grateful
and glad that i encountered her and had some of the best days of my
life because of her being in them. While Dido sings this part, it
shows her house getting bulldozed and completely destroyed! It seems
like that Dido in the video is likely having the worst day of her
life! Is she singing sincerely or ironically??
</p>


<p>
After everything that has happened in my life - with the beautiful and
meaningful relationship that comes to my mind on hearing Dido in the
song and the way in which it ended being so painful that it destroyed
me in many ways that comes to my mind on seeing Dido in the video,
I've come to lean more towards the theory that she's singing
sincerely. That even as her house has been torn down, she feels
grateful and glad for her partner's presence in her life. The partner
.. that is nowhere near her in the video as something really
unfortunate is happening in her life.
</p>

<p>
Now wait a minute. All this while I've been talking about this person
being her partner. This is what I assumed about the person being
referred to by her all this while. But it could just as well be a
friend, or a parent, or one's child even. It still seems most fitting
for the song to be about a partner, but there's some ambiguity here
too. As I was seeing the music video while writing about it just now,
it dawned on me that the entire time she is looking into the camera,
at ME! IS the person she's referring to the whole time .. me? That
can't be it - She does't know me at all and I've not been around
her. Maybe it is about the people who listen to her music. But then
what about the references to the picture on her wall, her getting the
call on the way to work, and her getting handed the towel as she
returns from outside soaking wet due to the rain? It has to be someone
more personal than me or the general person who listens to her
music. So I guess we're back to a lover or a partner being the most
likely person in question here.
</p>


<p>
Are all these little details in the video deliberate? The partner not
being around her as her house is torn down, her looking into the
camera (at us) while singing thank you, her not revealing her emotions
very clearly as everything is happening. oh the ambiguity and
bittersweetness of love..

<br> "with the birds i'll share this lonely viewin'"
<br>- sings the lead singer of RHCP in the song "scar tissue"

<p>
  i've needed writing the most when i was depressed and it is exactly
  then that it failed me. my capacities failed me. i need a muscle
  that i can exercise unthinkingly. i can't wait for a perfect moment
  to start. but then what? write about the ordinary?
</p>
  
"with the birds i'll share this lonely viewin'"

<p>
    maybe if i just spurt, for a start, anything or whatever that
    comes to my brain.. then maybe (maybe), i can launch off (segue)
    into something more appropriate.
</p>
    
"
<br>scar tissue that i wish you saw kentucky girl in a pushup bra
with
<br> the birds i'll share this lonely viewin' with the birds i'll
share
<br> this lonely viewin'
<br>lonely viewin' lonely viewwwwwin'
<br>"
<br>
<br>  are you looking at me? are you looking at me still dear Nbo?
