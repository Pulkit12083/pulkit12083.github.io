<strong>What am I?</strong>
- An amorphous philistine
- philanderer in philosophy, code, political theory, algorithms, software, and confusion.
- A bundle of questions emerging from a critical rejection of conventional social norms
- A fusion of influences, some of which cited and discussed on this website. 

<strong>What am I not?</strong>
- Not an instantiation of a platonic abstraction.
- Not a "software engineer", "man", "son", "_ist", or "_ian". 
- Not solely a consumer.
- Not what clothes I wear, what films I watch, what objects I purchase. 
- Not a solipsist.
- Not a singular cartesian entity emerging from vacuum. 
  
<strong>What do I currently care (and write) about?</strong>
- Writing better programs and solving interesting algorithmic problems.
- Crafting a political consciousness unclouded by reification and dogma
- Imagining a life more meaningful than one dictated by <a href="bourgeoisinjunctions.html">bourgeois injunctions</a>
- Understanding violence, particularly its systemic manifestations.
- The politics of contentment socially contingent upon the suffering of another.
- Division of labour and what it means for my social existence. 
- Eschewing conventional notions of machismo (<a href="img_made/morefemme.jpg" target="_blank">aesthetic</a> and behavioral)
