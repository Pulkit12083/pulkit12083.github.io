<b><u>Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus Value</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch12.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>


Lets fix the working day now.
Lets assume that after a protracted civil war of regulation it is fixed at 10 hours.

These 10 hours of labour can be divided in 2 parts:
PART1: the time spent by labour producing enough value to sustain itself (its own wages)
PART2: the time spent by labour producing surplus value for the capitalist

Since PART1+PART2=10 (fixed), any increase in PART2 (which the capitalist wants) can only come by reducing PART1.

To reduce PART1 (the time spent by labour producing enough value to sustain itself (its own wages) we need to make the process of production more efficient.
This efficiency is brought by "revolutionizing" the labour-process or the means of production. Either by technological advances. Or increases in productivity by changing techniques.
Or by increased productivity in making the resources used in the labour process. So the labour-time needed for PART-1 reduces, rendering more free time for surplus value.

The capitalist has a direct monetary incentive to increase labour-productivity or technologically revolutionize the labour-process.

However this does not lead to shortening of the work day. But merely the expansion of the surplus value produced for the capitalist.


This is the crux of the chapter. Basic arithmetic.

<u><b>Notable excerpts and remarks</b></u>
<p style="color:#FF8B03";>
  1. <i>"The prolongation of the surplus-labour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour; or a portion of the labour-time previously consumed, in reality, for the labourer’s own benefit, would be converted into labour-time for the benefit of the capitalist. There would be an alteration, not in the length of the working day, but in its division into necessary labour-time and surplus labour-time."</i>

  2. <i>"The surplus-value produced by prolongation of the working day, I call absolute surplus-value. On the other hand, the surplus-value arising from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the working day, I call relative surplus-value."</i>

  3. <i>"A fall in the value of labour-power is also brought about by an increase in the productiveness of labour, and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of labour and the raw material, that form the material elements of the constant capital required for producing the necessaries of life. But an increase in the productiveness of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the necessaries of life, nor the means of production for such necessaries, leaves the value of labour-power undisturbed."</i>

  4. <i>"The shortening of the working day is, therefore, by no means what is aimed at, in capitalist production, when labour is economised by increasing its productiveness. [8] It is only the shortening of the labour-time, necessary for the production of a definite quantity of commodities, that is aimed at. The fact that the workman, when the productiveness of his labour has been increased, produces, say 10 times as many commodities as before, and thus spends one-tenth as much labour-time on each, by no means prevents him from continuing to work 12 hours as before, nor from producing in those 12 hours 1,200 articles instead of 120. Nay, more, his working day may be prolonged at the same time, so as to make him produce, say 1,400 articles in 14 hours. In the treatises, therefore, of economists of the stamp of MacCulloch, Ure, Senior, and tutti quanti [the like], we may read upon one page, that the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital for developing his productiveness, because the necessary labour-time is thereby shortened, and on the next page, that he must prove his gratitude by working in future for 15 hours instead of 10. The object of all development of the productiveness of labour, within the limits of capitalist production, is to shorten that part of the working day, during which the workman must labour for his own benefit, and by that very shortening, to lengthen the other part of the day, during which he is at liberty to work gratis for the capitalist. How far this result is also attainable, without cheapening commodities, will appear from an examination of the particular modes of producing relative surplus-value, to which examination we now proceed.</i></p>

<b><u>Chapter 13: Co-operation</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch13.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>

1. Surplus value produced is proportional to the number of laborers employed. By increasing the number of laborers, at first the change in the wokshop is only quantitative but after a certain degree becomes qualitative too. "Capitalist production only then really begins, as we have already seen, when each individual capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers; when consequently the labour-process is carried on on an extensive scale and yields, relatively, large quantities of products."


2. The collective working-day of a large number of workmen simultaneously employed, divided by the number of these workmen, gives one day of average social labour.

3. Even without an alteration in the system of working, the simultaneous employment of a large number of labourers effects a revolution in the material conditions of the labour-process. The costs of labour don't scale linearly and consequently producing larger quantities becomes cheaper.


On labour acquiring a "social character";

<i>" The economy in their application is entirely owing to their being consumed in common by a large number of workmen. Moreover, this character of being necessary conditions of social labour, a character that distinguishes them from the dispersed and relatively more costly means of production of isolated, independent labourers, or small masters, is acquired even when the numerous workmen assembled together do not assist one another, but merely work side by side. A portion of the instruments of labour acquires this social character before the labour-process itself does so. "</i>


4. "When numerous labourers work together side by side, whether in one and the same process, or in different but connected processes, they are said to co-operate, or to work in co-operation."


5. Productivity increases more than linearly due to parallelization with greater workers.

6. Cooperation also cuts down useless expenses.

7.<i> The number of the labourers that co-operate, or the scale of co-operation, depends, in the first instance, on the amount of capital that the individual capitalist can spare for the purchase of labour-power; in other words, on the extent to which a single capitalist has command over the means of subsistence of a number of labourers.. the co-operation of wage labourers is entirely brought about by the capital that employs them."</i>

8. Managers are now required.

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>"In the elementary form, under which we have hitherto viewed it, co-operation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large scale, but it does not, in itself, represent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production. At the most it appears to do so, and that only approximately, in the handicraft-like beginnings of manufacture, [22] and in that kind of agriculture on a large scale, which corresponds to the epoch of manufacture, and is distinguished from peasant agriculture, mainly by the number of the labourers simultaneously employed, and by the mass of the means of production concentrated for their use. Simple co-operation is always the prevailing form, in those branches of production in which capital operates on a large scale, and division of labour and machinery play but a subordinate part.

Co-operation ever constitutes the fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production, nevertheless the elementary form of co-operation continues to subsist as a particular form of capitalist production side by side with the more developed forms of that mode of production."</i></p>

<u><b>Remarks</b></u>

1. The treatment of cooperation as a special aspect of capitalist production seems unnecessary. But on the whole this chapter is not very contentious or new.


<hr>
<b><u>Chapter 14: Division of Labour and Manufacture</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm" target "_blank">(Read here)</a>

<u>Section 1: "Manufacture" (manufacturing?) "takes rise" in 2 ways.</u>

1. By the assemblage, in one workshop under the control of a single capitalist, of labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts through whose hands a given article must pass on its way to completion. A car going through different hands/processes in a workshop.
2. Workers/labourers under a capitalist, all making the same uniform commodity in a workshop engaged in the same process. (paper, needles)
---
* The final form is invariably the same – a productive mechanism whose parts are human beings.
* The decomposition of a process of production into its various successive steps coincides, here, strictly with the resolution of a handicraft into its successive manual operations.
* Manufacture splits up that particular handicraft into its various detail operations, isolating, and making these operations independent of one another up to the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer.

<u>Section 2: THE DETAIL LABOURER AND HIS IMPLEMENTS</u>

1. A labourer who all his life performs one and the same simple operation, converts his whole body into the automatic, specialised implement of that operation
2. Manufacturing leads to incrased specialization through the decomposition of the labour process into separate parts performed by different labourers simultaneously.
3. The conversion of fractional work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them into castes, or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes, to ossify them into guilds.
4. Such division of labour tends to be more efficient. Repeating a simpler task is faster than working on separate tasks to make a larger commodity.
5. The productiveness of labour depends not only on the proficiency of the workman, but on the perfection of his tools. With the specialization of the laborer, even tools need to be specialized (" In Birmingham alone 500 varieties of hammers are produced")


<u>Section 3: THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL FORMS OF MANUFACTURE: HETEROGENEOUS MANUFACTURE, SERIAL MANUFACTURE</u>

Any article/good results from the mere mechanical fitting together of partial products made independently (watch), or owes its completed shape to a series of connected processes and manipulations (locomotive).

The "collective worker"
    = "formed from the combination of the many specialized workers"
    = each worker a specialized organ of the whole 

There exists Mutual interdependence
    = a given proportionality to achieve continuity of all workers
    = appropriate number of workers for each operation
    = extension of scale by multiplying groups
    = different skills = different training = different values of labor power
    = hierachy of labor-powers, hierarchy of wages 

Simplification of tasks leads to the devaluation of labor power, as V decreases, S increases.

<u>Section 4: DIVISION OF LABOUR IN MANUFACTURE, AND DIVISION OF LABOUR IN SOCIETY</u>

1. Division of labor in society primarily emerges from differences in sex, age, modes of production, access to resources in different communities and exchange of goods. 

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>"Division of labour in a society, and the corresponding tying down of individuals to a particular calling, develops itself, just as does the division of labour in manufacture, from opposite starting-points. Within a family, [26] and after further development within a tribe, there springs up naturally a division of labour, caused by differences of sex and age, a division that is consequently based on a purely physiological foundation, which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the community, by the increase of population, and more especially, by the conflicts between different tribes, and the subjugation of one tribe by another. On the other hand, as I have before remarked, the exchange of products springs up at the points where different families, tribes, communities, come in contact; for, in the beginning of civilisation, it is not private individuals but families, tribes, &c., that meet on an independent footing. Different communities find different means of production, and different means of subsistence in their natural environment. Hence, their modes of production, and of living, and their products are different. It is this spontaneously developed difference which, when different communities come in contact, calls forth the mutual exchange of products, and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into commodities. Exchange does not create the differences between the spheres of production, but brings what are already different into relation, and thus converts them into more or less inter-dependent branches of the collective production of an enlarged society. In the latter case, the social division of labour arises from the exchange between spheres of production, that are originally distinct and independent of one another"</i></p>

2. Agglomeration in a workshop - or the density of communication in a population is a necessary condition for division of labour in society."A relatively thinly populated country, with well-developed means of communication, has a denser population than a more numerously populated country, with badly-developed means of communication; and in this sense the Northern States of the American Union, for instance, are more thickly populated than India."

3. Since the production and the circulation of commodities are the general pre-requisites of the capitalist mode of production, division of labour in manufacture demands, that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development.

<b>Differences:</b>

Division of labor in manufacturing:
--unmediated by exchange
--planned, organized by the despotism of capitalists
--depends for its development on growth of social division of labor
--implies the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men
--implies concentration of the means of production in the hands of one capitalist;

Division of labor in society;
--mediated by exchange of commodities (anarchy) e.g., cattle-breeding, tanning, shoemaking
--unplanned
--brings into contact independent commodity-producers, who acknowledge no other authority but that of competition, of the coercion exerted by the pressure of their mutual interests; just as in the animal kingdom
--dispersion among many independent producers of commodities.

4. The a priori system on which the division of labour, within the workshop, is regularly carried out, becomes in the division of labour within the society, an a posteriori, nature-imposed necessity, controlling the lawless caprice of the producers and perceptible in the barometrical fluctuations of the market-prices.

5. The opposite happened in earlier forms of society: —ancient Indian communities (where society was planned in the fomr of castes/guilds and workshop developments were more anarchic/sporadic)
    --fixed, authoritative plan of division of labor and village
    --blending of agriculture and handicrafts
    --mostly "self-sufficing" communities, production for use
     --each individual craftsman . . . conducts in his workshop all

6. division of labour in the workshop, as practised by manufacture, is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone.

<u>Section 5:THE CAPITALISTIC CHARACTER OF MANUFACTURE</u>

1. Some meaningless assertion about labour apperaing as the productive power of capital:  "In manufacture, as well as in simple co-operation, the collective working organism is a form of existence of capital. The mechanism that is made up of numerous individual detail labourers belongs to the capitalist. Hence, the productive power resulting from a combination of labours appears to be the productive power of capital."

2. Simple co-operation leaves the mode of working by the individual for the most part unchanged, manufacture thoroughly revolutionises it,
-- It converts the labourer into a crippled monstrosity, by forcing his detail dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities and instincts;
-- By nature unfitted to make anything independently, the manufacturing labourer develops productive activity as a mere appendage of the capitalist’s workshop
-- Intelligence in production expands in one direction, because it vanishes in many others.
-- Some crippling of body and mind is inseparable even from division of labour in society as a whole- however, manufacture carries this social separation of branches of labour much further, and also, by its peculiar division, attacks the individual at the very roots of his life
-- Co-operation based on division of labour, in other words, manufacture, commences as a spontaneous formation. So soon as it attains some consistence and extension, it becomes the recognised methodical and systematic form of capitalist production.


<u>Important excerpts</u>

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>* "By decomposition of handicrafts, by specialisation of the instruments of labour, by the formation of detail labourers, and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism, division of labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation, and a quantitative proportion in the social process of production; it consequently creates a definite organisation of the labour of society, and thereby develops at the same time new productive forces in the society. In its specific capitalist form – and under the given conditions, it could take no other form than a capitalistic one – manufacture is but a particular method of begetting relative surplus-value, or of augmenting at the expense of the labourer the self-expansion of capital – usually called social wealth, “Wealth of Nations,” &c. It increases the social productive power of labour, not only for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the labourer, but it does this by crippling the individual labourers. It creates new conditions for the lordship of capital over labour. If, therefore, on the one hand, it presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the economic development of society, on the other hand, it is a refined and civilised method of exploitation. "</i></p>

<p style="color:#FF8B03";><i>* "In consequence of the separation of the social branches of production, commodities are better made, the various bents and talents of men select a suitable field, [55] and without some restraint no important results can be obtained anywhere. [56] Hence both product and producer are improved by division of labour. "</i></p>

<u>Notes:</u>

1. Division of labour may have the psychological/anthropic effects mentioned here but doesn't automation/manufacturing also produce tools that can replace repititive manual human work allowing them to focus again on higher order and more abstract tasks? What would marx say about the information economy? People working desk jobs now with machines largely doing the manual grunt work? Does the delineation of manual-unskilled worker from skilled worker still stand?

2. Division of labour in society seems aptly described. 


<hr>
<b><u>Chapter 15: Machinery and Modern Industry</u></b> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm" target="_blank">(Read here)</a>

This chapter is largely obsolete and anachronistic, being read now in the 21st century with marx describing his own philosophical essence of machinery in the 19th century. I would not recommend reading this chapter or my notes on this since they serve no purpose/use anymore.

“It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil of any human being.”
- John Stuart Mill in “Principles of Political Economy":

<u>Section 1: THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINERY</u>

1. It is a means for producing surplus-value. Not for reducing daily toil.
2. All fully developed machinery consists of three essentially different parts, the motor mechanism, the transmitting mechanism, and finally the tool or working machine. (ummm....not anymore friendo)
3. Essentially: "The machine proper is therefore a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operations that were formerly done by the workman with similar tools."
4. "A system of machinery, whether it reposes on the mere co-operation of similar machines, as in weaving, or on a combination of different machines, as in spinning, constitutes in itself a huge automaton, whenever it is driven by a self-acting prime mover."
5. "An organised system of machines, to which motion is communicated by the transmitting mechanism from a central automaton, is the most developed form of production by machinery"
6. "Manufacture produced the machinery, by means of which modern industry abolished the handicraft and manufacturing systems in those spheres of production that it first seized upon."
7. "Revolution in the modes of production of industry and agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general conditions of the social process of production, i.e., in the means of communication and of transport."
8. "The most essential condition to the production of machines by machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of force, and yet under perfect control. "

In the place of the co-operation of humans, we have the co-operation of machines. In this process some humans are rendered redundant and expelled from production and others are reduced to being mere tenders of machines. This displacement accomplishes what is for Marx a fundamental change in the work process, one which had already begun in manufacturing but which is completed in modern industry. That change is the replacement of the central role of the worker in commanding the work process by the machine. From being the central subject who works, the worker is demoted to being one more cog in the system of machines. 

<u>Section 2: THE VALUE TRANSFERRED BY MACHINERY TO THE PRODUCT</u>

1. the productive forces resulting from co-operation and division of labour cost capital nothing. 
2. Natural forces cost capital nothing, but their exploitation through machinery requires costly investment 
3. Machinery
    --enters useful labor wholly, the whole machine is engaged
    --enters valorization bit by bit, adds what it loses by depreciation
    --so, the more labor required to produce the machine and the quicker it is used up, the more it transfers to the product
    --as the mass of machinery per worker grows so does C/V, the ratio of the value added by machinery (+ raw materials + intermediate goods) to the value of labor power 
4. It never adds more value than it loses, on an average, by wear and tear.  (largely wrong)
5. Given the rate at which machinery transfers its value to the product, the amount of value so transferred depends on the total value of the machinery. (largely wrong)
6. "The use of machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the product, is limited in this way, that less labour must be expended in producing the machinery than is displaced by the employment of that machinery, For the capitalist, however, this use is still more limited. Instead of paying for the labour, he only pays the value of the labour-power employed; therefore, the limit to his using a machine is fixed by the difference between the value of the machine and the value of the labour-power replaced by it."
<u><b>Remarks</b></u>

<u>SECTION 3: THE PROXIMATE EFFECTS OF MACHINERY ON THE WORKMAN</u>

1. "In so far as machinery dispenses with muscular power, it becomes a means of employing labourers of slight muscular strength, and those whose bodily development is incomplete, but whose limbs are all the more supple. The labour of women and children was, therefore, the first thing sought for by capitalists who used machinery."

2. "The value of labour-power was determined, not only by the labour-time necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer, but also by that necessary to maintain his family. Machinery, by throwing every member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads the value of the man’s labour-power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labour-power. "

3. Machinery draws in women and children

    --by reducing the need for muscle power, machinery makes it possible to employ less muscular women and children and to "break" the resistance of male workers
    --so the whole family enters the factory
    --this reduces time for housework, time for play
    --less time to cook, to care for infants, to sew; thus need to buy substitute commodities
    --less time for children to learn these domestic skills
    --male labor devalorized, family wage spread across earnings of all family members
    --devastating impact on children's health
    --"thrown into a situation physically and morally polluted"
    --high infant death rates
    --insufficient nourishment, dosing with opiates
    --intentional starving and poisoning
    --"intellectual degeneration", led to unenforced or subverted laws mandating schooling
    --some "schools" were not really schools at all
    --overcrowded, to few teachers, too few materials
    --close, noisome atmosphere 

4. Machinery prolongs the working day

    --machinery as "perpetual motion", limited only by worker endurance and resistance
    --use of women and children lessens resistance of class as a whole
    --increased working day means more rapid turnover of machinery, more surplus value
    --increasing the length of working day reduces marginal costs fixed in machinery
    --this is of increasing importance as C/V rises
    --monopoly introduction of machinery by individual capital lowers costs and gives increased surplus value
    --Contradiction: increase in C displaces V and potential for S
    --displacement of V by C offsets rise in S/V and creates pressure for capitalists to compensate for loss in relative surplus value by increasing working day and absolute surplus value
    --displacement of V produces "a surplus working population"
    --by "revolutionizing" "the mode of labor as well as the social organism" machinery breaks the resistance of workers ["decomposition" of working class power] 

5. Machinery intensifies labor

    --limitation of length of working day leads to increased use of machinery
    --to increase productivity and relative surplus value
    --to increase the intensity of labor and thus surplus value
    --intensification via "heightened tension of labor-power"
    --intensification via "a closer filling up of the pores of the working day"
    --labor-time now "acquires a measure of its intensity, or degree of density"
    --intensification achieved via piece wages
    --shortening of labor time makes increased intensity possible —"subjective condition"
    --intensification achieved via speed-up of machines
    --intensification achieved via having one worker tend more machines, e.g., cotton looms
    --intensification undermines workers' health , e.g., exhaustion, lung disease
    --intensification leads to further struggle for shortening of working day, e.g., 8-hours movement 

<u>Section 4: THE FACTORY</u>

1. "To work at a machine, the workman should be taught from childhood, in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton. "

2. "Although then, technically speaking, the old system of division of labour is thrown overboard by machinery, it hangs on in the factory, as a traditional habit handed down from Manufacture, and is afterwards systematically re-moulded and established in a more hideous form by capital, as a means of exploiting labour-power. The life-long speciality of handling one and the same tool, now becomes the life-long speciality of serving one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong use, with the object of transforming the workman, from his very childhood, into a part of a detail-machine."

3. "At the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost, it does away with the many-sided play of the muscles, and confiscates every atom of freedom, both in bodily and intellectual activity."

4. "Every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree by artificial elevation of the temperature, by the dust-laden atmosphere, by the deafening noise, not to mention danger to life and limb among the thickly crowded machinery, which, with the regularity of the seasons, issues its list of the killed and wounded in the industrial battle."


<u>Section 5- Section 10</u>


[coming soon]


Notes:

Reading about factory work and the drastic changes in employment brought by the invention of newer mechanical tools in the 19th century is sort of trippy.  
The division between manual laborer and the factory owner seems much more distinct.  
And it seems evident that mechanical improvements were leading to major optimizations in ways that are now superseded significantly later on by other optimizations - presumably around exchange and now those in terms of software?
