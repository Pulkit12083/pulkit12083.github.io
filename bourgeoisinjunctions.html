<b>A compilation of injunctions and diktats that I encounter often: promulgated towards me by advertising, or friends influenced by advertising, or friends influenced by films influenced by advertising or family influenced by advertising. Forms of life espoused by pop culture and glorified by those responsible for its reproduction and persistence. Forms purchased in ideology by a population that identifies itself first as consumers and then as anything else. This is my attempt to locate the most common bourgeois ideological imperatives</b>
