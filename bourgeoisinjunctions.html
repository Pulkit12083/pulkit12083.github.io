<b>A compilation of injunctions and diktats that I encounter often: promulgated towards me by advertising, or friends influenced by advertising, or friends influenced by films influenced by advertising or family influenced by advertising. Forms of life espoused by pop culture and glorified by those responsible for its reproduction and persistence. Forms purchased in ideology by a population that identifies itself first as consumers and then as anything else. This is my attempt to locate the most common bourgeois ideological imperatives</b>

-> To purchase objects
-> To have 'fun': and make it the pursuit of one's parawork life. 
-> To travel: as a tourist to consume images of novel cities 
-> To harbor the protestant work ethic: irrespective of the work provided
-> To constantly maximize productivity: independent of the the product
-> To prioritize career over all else: socio-political development, lov
-> To drink: as the predominant substance facilitating a social existence
-> To drink more than someone else: to describe worth 
-> To drink and have fun: as a measure of social success
-> To land lucrative employment: as a measure of personal success
-> To monogamously form romantic love: with a specific kind of model woman.
-> To practice mindfulness: to diffuse anxieties/discontents
-> To be positive: avoid skepticism and critical inquiry into existing systems
-> To work overtime, seek promotions and higher ranked positions
-> To be a sophisticate: appreciate meaningless formalistic art
-> To speak standard written english: as a measure of one's erudition
-> To wear branded clothes: as a source of personal confidence & attract women
-> To not demand violent radical change and instead hope for liberal reform
-> To not whine about the inadequacy of current systems
-> To assume greed and selfishness are natural human traits
-> To identify a clear sense of individualist self
-> To primarily live for one's own individual self
-> To invest money: into the stock market
