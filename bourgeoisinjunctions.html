<b>A compilation of injunctions and diktats that I encounter often: promulgated towards me by advertising, or friends influenced by advertising, or friends influenced by films influenced by advertising or family influenced by advertising. Forms of life espoused by pop culture and glorified by those responsible for its reproduction and persistence. Forms purchased in ideology by a population that identifies itself first as consumers and then as anything else. This is my attempt to locate the most common bourgeois ideological imperatives</b>

   -- Purchase expensive personal automobiles

-> Make individual consumption the pursuit of one's parawork life. 
-> Travel: as a tourist to consume images of novel cities 
-> Harbor the protestant work ethic: irrespective of the work provided
-> Constantly maximize productivity: independent of the the product
-> Prioritize career over all else: over cultural or socio-political development

-> Drink more than someone else: to describe worth 
-> Drink and have fun: as a measure of social success
-> Land lucrative employment: as a measure of personal success
-> Monogamously form romantic love: with a specific model partner..
-> Practice mindfulness: to diffuse anxieties/discontents
-> Be positive: avoid skepticism and critical inquiry into existing systems
-> Work overtime, seek promotions and higher ranked positions
-> Be sophisticated: appreciate meaningless formalistic art
-> Speak standard written english: as a measure of one's erudition
-> Wear branded clothes: as a source of personal confidence & attract a model spouse.
-> Not demand radical change and instead hope for liberal reform
-> Not whine about the inadequacy of current systems
-> Assume greed and selfishness are natural human traits
-> Identify a clear sense of individualist self
-> Primarily live for one's own individual self
-> Invest money: into the stock market
