This is spilling out at 3:00AM on a Friday morning. My total sense of disbelief at relationship essentialism. And how it seems to sustain itself through language. I see in this the most painfully brilliant example of language seems to have conditioned a thought model that I in a moment of final unravelling have seen come apart in my head and at exactly 3:00AM on this Friday night, its final influences lie ahead me in a corpse that I have not much time to investigate before it decomposes and leaves my understanding forever. I have, in effect, an exceedingly short amount of time before I begin to assert "I don't unerstand why people .." about this specific mode of behavior.

<b>Linguistic Essentialism:</b>
I discussed Sartre's failure to become existentialist due to hsi failure to read wittgenstein and recognize that all linguistic phrasing is essentially essentialist. This essentialism is necessary for abstraction and talk about objects. It's impossible to conceive of objects without the use which they pose to us. Let me reiterate this. It is impossible to conceive of objects without the use which we conceive of them. My first impression about this is: what the fuck? Language use. Thought is language. Thought is use. All objects are conceived of by thought and consequently Each object is conceived of on the basis of the use which they pose to us. This is the most radically materialist and social position I have ever held that I can consider phenomenological. This phenomenology isn't metaphysical however. It is a self contained construction. Describing itself through historical unfolding rooting itself into the observable - what is there. speaking about what is there. It is the reality talking about reality. It is self referential and complete. It is reality. That is to say that it does not exist in any antithesis to an imagined non-reality. especially if we define reality to be what is the case - what is there - what IS. This materialist conception of phenomenology is predicated upon the as yet unproven hypothesis that Language is use. I am relying on wittgenstein for this but eventually  will have to launch my own investigation into the matter - if the evolution of words/phrases/sentences/essays/books/dictionaries came to be for the use they carried. Well an investigation into this would perhaps involve the study of words/phrases/sentences all of which ar linguistic constructs -- abstract essentialist forms imparted to shaped ink on paper, on wood, on walls or shaped pixel configurations on screens, or shaped vibrating air striking an eardrum after beginning their journey from another object that looks like what I call a human. A material acting on some material for it to "arrive" at my material. Removing the abstract essentialism of the process of "arrival", it would appear by futher dissociation that material is acting upon itself. However I perceive material in a space. Space torn apart and fragmented over three axis. Given space, size, shape, expanse via a scale. The scale is a social construct. The three dimensional axis is a social construct. This is going to sound horribly unintuitive and meaningless but entertain the idea that if movement as it appears to me phenomenologically at the moment in which i abstract five distinct objects: Point-A, space1, object, space2, PointB. On abstracting these three distinct pictures from a singular picture and working on the assumption that space1 is expandable and space2 is compressible, I conceive of movement of object from Point-A to Point-B. Yet I do not conceive of movement of a sliding bar on a linear axis on my computer screen which involves not the movement of an object from one end of the bar to another but the synchronized blinking of pixels. Movement is a linguistic myth. Space is a linguistic myth. 

Economic abstractions lie on the extreme end of reification. Perhaps knowledge consists of acquiring the skill of manipulation of a reified reality and acquiring the skill to undo said reification and finding better reified forms better use. I have arrived at a point where I do not see the material benefits I have to confer to the world as it exists in today's reified form. But that is a practical question to which I will formulate a response [linguistic and material] once I am rid from my faith in the merits of earning more money here. To be rid of faiths is freedom. Yet I have faith in my own destruction - which feeds the impending destructio itself. Yet I know that I can not sustain a period of prolonged destruction since its logical end will necessarily reside in death. I suppose it's hard to see anything but that degree of destruction when alternatives that exist that once promised to be useful have lost thier ability to convince you of their faith. 


<b>Relationship essentialism:</b>

I can not conceive any longer the specific mental orientation require to sustain the mythology holding specific people in specific regard independently of the daily material involvement between them and me. On ceasing to think of my interactions with them through the specific roles I expect them to enumerate I see my engagement with them I find myself freed from the impulse to contain how I act. And in my everyday relations it has been sufficiently long for me to exist in a free state - a single, uninstitutionalized isolated individual whose interactions mostly exist on a uniformly heterogenous space where neither is clearly encapsulated in a clear model. However it would be a folly to not see that these relationships exist in their current form and were formed by some essentialist conception I held out when they began and when I put effort into them - and the essentialist conceptions some of them still hold. Perhaps a notion of love and spiritual desire began to be borne from it. And that sustains the interest of many in me - even through my practical material use to them is little. The corpse lying ahead of me is the abstraction of a lover. What explanation do I have for the faith in this idea. What is materially different in my relationship with a lover by them being a lover - the ease of access to emotional support and sex? What if both was available from sources not the lover - then would the desire for a person as a lover as such still persist? Don't we as children begin wanting a lover because of the benefits it will confer? Instead of a lover as a lover. the benefits of a partner who will help us through life by hearing our dilemmas and helping us resolve them. by creating physical intimacy with us. by creating the rush of excitement felt on the material security one has suddenly felt materialize in one's inductive hope rising when someone holds our hand. Gestures of affection emerging from and dissolving in our needs to guarantee for ourselves or those around us the minimums about our engagement in the future. We do these on farewells too however - maybe to fulfill the desire for bodily contact to sustain the memory of how it felt with them before we lose track and forget how that feels like. Losing not only an experience but how to discover it. The rediscovery of certain affections is no doubt such a beautiful and brilliant phenomenon. Having rediscovered such a useful abstraction. I expect to see societal increase in faith in families and monogamous clearly categorized relationships with the rise of material insecurity. I expect one to find most beautiful the concept of a family in spaces of material scarcity. 


At some point I wanted a lover. A singular lover to myself. That desire grew from some social wants/needs and eventually detached itself into a desire unto itself. The spiritual myth feeding itself. But the material realities dashing such idealist expectations on the first serious confrontation with what that meant. Since then, perhaps I have had some occasions on which I saw my peers as my equals instead of seeing myself as being an inhuman alienated lesser being. And with that process, the desire for a lover withered away. On the demystification of love I have found it increasingly more difficult to convince myself of its mystic qualities. Perhaps that is why I am so keen to look at the corpse of love before it withers away. Just as an atheist finds it hard to convince himself of the rituals of organized religion, I will eventually find it harder to convince myself of the rituals of labelled relationships. And with the loss of this faith, I shall lose all the spiritual comforting faiths that come with it. Whatever sense of pretty beauty they induced. 

<b>I do not know what the conclusions of this social materialism lead me to. The logical end of the demystification of abstractions - of being a being without faith if such a thing can meaningfully be understood or believed. </b>
Isn't music religious? 
The enforcement of an ideology.
The mixture of sonic pleasure with ideological lyricism in a symbiotic relationship in which each enforces the other. 
The sounds associated with a certain childhood faith gaining some mystical comforting quality of that faith being reproducible - just like the music as reproduced from the speaker. 
Maybe Terre Thaemlitz will help discover the material roots of my participation with music. Well not music as an abstraction but music as a material phenomenon - sounds that proliferate and arrive to me from material social events distilling through producers/people using tools to organize what they hear and distribute it through an industry that uses its own tools for replication and playback over certain populations that can afford to pay for the process. 

I don't know if any of this will hold up tomorrow. I do know that my understanding of phenomenon unfolding materially as I have heard it traced by someone like Terre has been more satisfactory in equipping me with a critical language than any abstract philosophy has been. 

Note to self: talk to atheists who converted later on in life and ask if they feel greater tendencies of depression (although their conversion might have occurred by a process of attaining freedom from religious restriction). Maybe ask someone who lost faith out of disappointment. Do children experience a sense of great loss on becoming irreligious? One that is blunted by how gradual it can be? Or do they become irreligous in a process which makes them realize that they don't need to rely on said faith. Perhaps a better person to ask would be someone who has lost their faith on realizing its inconsistent and unreliability as opposed to the withering away of their reliance on it.
