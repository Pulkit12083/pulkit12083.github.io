META: I'll post some poems I've found. I wanted to write poetry at some point but have said my farewell to it recently.

  <div class="poem-text"><i>(although does this really matter? isn't the literary author dead?)</i>

I like fiction he said
The lives of nonexistent he read
No dearth of coin, liquor and talk
Yet drawn to authors long dead

Books for when he was bored
The existent starving he ignored
No dearth of anguish on his street
Yet Kafka's misery he adored

Hardcovers for a fine collection
Cardboard with meaning and reflection
No dearth of stories lost outside in flesh
Yet protagonists made an exquisite selection

I like fiction he said
And only fiction not reality he pled
No dearth of coin, liquor and talk
The street's ugliness must be adorned and read

  <div class="poem-title">All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace</div>
  <div class="poem-author">Richard Brautigan</div>
  <div class="poem-text">

I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
(right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

  <div class="poem-title">Tonight</div>
  <div class="poem-author">by Agha Shahid Ali</div>
  <div class="poem-text">

    “Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar”
                —Laurence Hope


Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight?
Whom else from rapture’s road will you expel tonight?

Those “Fabrics of Cashmere—” “to make Me beautiful—”
“Trinket”—to gem—“Me to adorn—How tell”—tonight?

I beg for haven: Prisons, let open your gates—
A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight.

God’s vintage loneliness has turned to vinegar—
All the archangels—their wings frozen—fell tonight.

Lord, cried out the idols, Don’t let us be broken;
Only we can convert the infidel tonight.

Mughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities
multiply me at once under your spell tonight.

He’s freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.
He’s left open—for God—the doors of Hell tonight.

In the heart’s veined temple, all statues have been smashed.
No priest in saffron’s left to toll its knell tonight.

God, limit these punishments, there’s still Judgment Day—
I’m a mere sinner, I’m no infidel tonight.

Executioners near the woman at the window.
Damn you, Elijah, I’ll bless Jezebel tonight.

The hunt is over, and I hear the Call to Prayer
fade into that of the wounded gazelle tonight.

My rivals for your love—you’ve invited them all?
This is mere insult, this is no farewell tonight.

And I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee—
God sobs in my arms. Call me Ishmael tonight.

  <div class="poem-title">When You Are Old</div>
  <div class="poem-author">Wiliam Butler Yeats</div>
  <div class="poem-text">

When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
