META: I'll post some poems I've found. I wanted to write poetry at some point but have said my farewell to it recently.

<b>I like fiction</b>
By Pulkit Manocha <i>(although does this really matter? isn't the literary author dead?)</i>

I like fiction he said
The lives of nonexistent he read
No dearth of coin, liquor and talk
Yet drawn to authors long dead

Books for when he was bored
The existent starving he ignored
No dearth of anguish on his street
Yet Kafka's misery he adored

Hardcovers for a fine collection
Cardboard with meaning and reflection
No dearth of stories lost outside in flesh
Yet protagonists made an exquisite selection

I like fiction he said
And only fiction not reality he pled
No dearth of coin, liquor and talk
The street's ugliness must be adorned and read
