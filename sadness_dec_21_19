Vagrancy. Poverty and loneliness.

I feel childish, stupid, numb, rotten, stagnant, ignorant, dull,
insipid, comfortable, pretentious, wasteful, indulgent, complacent.

Having lived a life of relative isolation here in the vacuum of a
hollow, empty, individualistic life. 

There is no tension, no urgency, no sense of importance to what I do.

Every question is equally important. 

Most my relationships are failures - founded on language instead of
material necessity.

I am lonely.

I am constantly distracting.

Each day taken in casually, and let go casually. 

I do not check time, date. Only days to discern proximity to the
weekend.

I have lost some conception of the value of money as I spend it here
in LA.

My expectations and hopes from relationships have diminished. 

The sharpness and tension with which I attempt problems has
disappeared for a blunt apathy.

Maybe because I allowed myself all this space which I didn't have.

Maybe because my health beat me down in isolation here.

I find it sickening that the only way I can contribute to anyone's
life is by buying something for them.

I hate annie. I have not had the courage to say it bubt i cannot stand
her self absorption. Her fragility unable to tolerate the vitriol it
engenders in me. 

I feel like a child, patronized by the languages of those around me.

Perhaps my illness has much to do with this childishness as Berger
suggests.

I cannot find much in common with anyone. In LA. In Delhi. My
transformation into someone in exile who belongs nowhere is complete.

I cannot speak the language of my home. Or the language of where I
have arrived. 

The biggest decisions in my life revolve around picking a restaurant
or a film.
