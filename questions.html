Some questions that baffle me. Some of them sincere curiosities but most betraying a personal opinion by having posed the question.

<b>1. Why do people marry? </b>

--  Marriage, as I see it, is categorically differentiated from a live-in relationship by a document informing a nation state of who you have sexual relations with. Perhaps a celebratory and religious event is involved where this information is sent out to family you rarely talk to, friends you don't personally care about and a god the question of whose existence you never settled. But primarily it is the document describing to the state who you're fucking. But hey now, why does the state want to know? <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm"> Engels might have an answer</a> but we'll come to him later; besides most older german political theorist critiques are irrelevant if they cannot be arrived at from the material of contemporary society as it presents itself to you (and I doubt that one person discerned the historical process which caused the family to emerge across all independently emerging tribes/territories although that's not in itself an argument against what he purports). One reason could be that it allows the state to hold the progenitors of children accountable for their wellbeing but I do not see why that can't be done when providing the little ones their birth certificates. Perhaps it is logistically difficult to pinpoint the owners of little humans to which my question would be "isn't it better to agitate for state child care?". The question of state child care is a controversial one which I shall return to later. Another reason we inform the state of our personal relationship status is the incentives (tax or otherwise) it provides to you. Which begs the question about why it is that the state would incentivize you to marry in the first place. This is something I sincerely am curious about so I'll put a pin on this for now.

-- Marriage confers the benefit of "locking down the one before it is too late" into a relationship with you. Each word of the quoted sentence opens a fresh new set of rabbit holes with nothing but festering worms to examine and wade through. 
---- "Locking down" seems to imply that you intend to keep a person beholden to you out of an obligatory contractual commitment instead of their will/desire. What sort of joy/happiness can be derived in the company of a human forced to participate in an activity against their will? What joys of wageslavery give one the impression that contractual commitments are a good idea? 
---- "the one" seems to imply that there exists precisely one individual who will categorically, naturally, biologically will be perfect for you or at least better than anyone else. I don't think that romantic delusions of perfect people merit discussion but I do think that the romantic ideal of "the one" needs to be addressed. Maybe they're not perfect but to you they become so over time. To anyone who poses this question to me I ask: "would you find your social needs satisfied if nobody existed on the planet but this person?". Would one be willing to forego their family, friends, peers, mentors, television shows with other people in it, films with actors/characters, books written by people through millenia, and the whole range of human activity that arises from people not "the one"? Probably not. Maybe "the one" is supposed to be uniquely desirable in a very specific context: the non-platonic context. What exactly is "non-platonic" and in what form is it distinguishable from "platonic"? Since we're on the topic of Plato: I must exclaim: "Fuck Plato". Now we're done witht that, I have realized over time that perhaps I do not necessarily know how my feelings towards my emotionally supportive friends are necessarily different from my emotionally supportive lovers. I do not necessarily know if they're qualitatively different and I've found my bourgeoning affections for those close to me emerge in no distinctive form that divides itself in "lover" and "friend" - words that seem to have lost their practical utility and ability to describe how I feel. Maybe this might not be the case with someone else. so my next question ends up being:


<b>2. What is the qualitative difference between a platonic relationship and a nonplatonic relationship? What is a relationship exactly?</b>

-- I don't necessarily want to delve into the philosophical analities of conflating "relations" as used in discrete mathematics but I would like to know how one delineates one's interaction with a friend and a stranger and which of the two can be described as a relationship and which can not? Isn't an evening spent with a stranger a relationship just as much as repeated interactions with a friend - albeit the former more fleeting than the latter? I'm often told that non-platonic feelings are distinguished by sexual attraction but I'm yet to meet anyone who can honestly admit to me that they're sexually attracted exclusively to the one person they're "in a relationship" with. Are you not in a relationship with your family? Friends? Teachers? Coworkers? do you not feel emotionally close to your family? Friends? Peers? Do you not feel sexually attracted to your coworkers? Models on billboards? Partners of others? So in what way does the person you're with hold a special position of repeated interaction? I suspect that the hetero-family arose from a specific historical process and was justified using some christian victorian notion of morality which has embedded itself particularly deep into modern psyche but this sort of vague conjecturing often falls apart without proper research so I suppose I will pose my next question:

<b>3. What are the specific historical processes that led to the emergence of the categories of "family", "platonic love", "non platonic love" and well, even as far as "parent". what was the use which necessitated the identification of these descriptors: the identification of one's father?</b>

Perhaps he held responsibility of gathering food in a patriarchal society but perhaps it is something that might become moot eventually.

-- Another process that I see perpetuating marriage and exclusivity is more of a game theoretic estimation of loneliness. Modern life is deeply disturbing - you're supposed to sell yourself on the market and constantly compete in your career and personal relationships for the attention of recruitors and the sex that you're attracted to. The imperative to "enjoy life", "fuck hot people", "climb the ladder" need no introductions. Perhaps life does get easier when there's a companion with whom you can decide to plan ahead and engage in a symbiotic agreement of support. And such companions will come in exceedingly short supply after a specific age since your choice not to marry will probably come in a society where not many others are making that same choice. So just like the prisoner who betrays the other and settles for a lower reward, you realize that since nobody else is foregoing sexual ownership of their significant others, it is detrimental for you to do so. We're then all caught in this collective game where the nash equilibria exists either in the vast majority of the population ceasing to marry all at once and enjoying the fruits of free and open relationships or them all continuing to marry and settling for the rotten exclusive limited life of a singular partner. Maybe loneliness and terrors of modern capitalist life needn't be absorbed by a singular individual waiting at home but a community of relationships with friends, elders, neighbors and workers which might be far healthier?

<b>4. What is it that induces the sort of discomfort and unacceptability in one on realizing that their partner has been sexually intimate with someone else?</b>

-- Well. Dishonesty and trust are important are the basic material for any fruitful relatioship. Yes but the dishonesty arises due to the prohibition of sexual intimacy in the first place. What if your significant other disclosed their sexual interest in someone else to you? What then? The common explanation is that it hurts to see one's partner that intimate with someone else. But why? "Because I have been replaced". But have you? Let us entertain the radical notion that no two relationships are exactly alike: something that virtually ANYONE I have ever talked to who has been in more than a single relationship would agree. Perhaps we see ourselves as replaceable because we, terrified of being ordinary, generic, uninteresting and unspecial are insecure about our necessity to one who holds us dear. But then I look at each person I have ever met and exclaim that not a single pair of individuals who i have known in my life for more than two days brought to me a set of experiences and conversations that seemed exactly alike. Their language, bodies, histories are particularly unique and specific (unless you're part of the dehumanizing ritualistic greek life in an american university in which case I agree that you're essentially a replicated stereotype). If you believe that the necessity of your genitals to your partner is in danger because they've been with someone else then perhaps your partner sees you not more than just your genitals and perhaps they've not had the language to describe how specifically and uniquely your body and its behavior is in bed with them. 





===================================================

This.. has become needlessly tedious. And graphic. I'll stop my ramble for now and come back to rearrange the word vomit that I see on my machine right now. I aspire for freedom and I see the abstraction of the family deeply rooted against that aspiration. Not to mention the whole host of miseries and sufferings that arise and have been documented in films, literature and music since forever - each cognizant of the trap that it is yet each unwilling to entertain the supposedly radical notion of continuing the "Dating" model into adulthood. 


That is it? no. excuse the trite torturous tedium tendered to thou here, I will fix this whenever I can find the time to give a fuck in the limited time afforded to me by wageslavery.
