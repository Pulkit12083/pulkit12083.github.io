Wingnut Dishwasher's union. - my idea of fun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AagXbraxPK0

         
something endearing
the simple and basic dreams of having enough to eat
to not be criminalized for wanting to die
to not be institutionalized
to be left alone by the cops
to want neighborhoods where one feels enough
to want help making this
to want freedom from law
to want freedom from jobs
to want freedom from microsoft
to want freedom from stocks
to feel enough


---
as angsty and naive it feels - there is something blunt about it because it knows something needs to be said even if it is simple and basic. to demand and end to hunger despite knowing how we're cynically taught to casually accept that hunger can somehow not be ended and anyone who demands it is a sincere naive simpleton. to very sincerely challenge the cynicism that makes us simply accept that prisons need to exist. to challenge that pragmatic adjusted realist and simply ask for freedom from cops. because it needs to be stated that it is not an impossible dream to be given up on. to remind that it can be demanded. it is not utopian to ask for freedom from property. to not be dismissed for wanting a what is possible - but forgotten about in living everyday. 

a simple objection to the certainty in today's conditions. 
to not even speak of wanting a roof for all and asked to accept that it is too large a problem. to curtail's one imagination in what is possible with the rhetoric that asks one to be realistic. to curtail one's imagination from going to a place that we can build but are told we can't. to be constantly discouraged from wanting more. 

It's a time where the expectation of having enought to eat in a place which throws half its grain away each year feels radical. 

i'm often asked what i want. almost always by those close enough to me who care enough to see a sense of anguish in my voice and on my face and wonder how it can be helped.
i don't often know what to say to them except "not this". 
maybe i should concretize my wants/desires.
wants/desires that aren't utopian but account for constraints of a reality beyond the scope for human action. 
what do i expect?
what do i expect?
what do i expect?
what do i expect?
what do i expect?

'an economy where everyone will finally get enough to eat'?
freedom from being subjected to the application of power by those who weild it in my proximity?
nothing can be demanded or asked for. 
one can't be asked to act against one's own self interest.
one must not ask
one must not demand
one must seize
i want to discover the ways to seize my freedom
i want to discover the ways for those who i care about to seize their freedom
to seize freedom from cops and the whims of an economy by restructuring the institutions that craft and give shape to our action
i can not do this alone
i am expected to act in institutions i find unacceptable
i want better institutions
i want, for starters, to acknowledge the need for better institutions and organization
i want someone to sit with me and talk about this need
i want someone to sit with me and talk about the importance of this need for me, them and those around us
i want someone to sit with me and talk about how this need can be addressed
i want someone to work with me on addressing this need
i want to work on addressing said needs
i want work that addresses needs
i want work that addresses a problem
if i do not have that i want freedom from it

<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC1yM-9Jwrk" target="_blank">Na jaane kyun hota hai ye zindagi ke saath</a></b>

The above sung by Lata Mangeshkar for a woman who in the film "Chhoti si baat"(1976) is at the point depicted in the video missing a coworker who she had developed a budding relationship with. The reasons for the coworker's absence - which she is not privy to - are disclosed to the audience. He has gone away for a while to learn from a "coach" the ways of sophistication which will allow to woo her on return.
The woman sings about why we tend to miss the little things about someone after they've left. The actress is in a contemplative state - although following her routine completely normally - a bit thrown off and probably wondering the reason for his disappearance more than she realizes is normal for a friendly coworker to think about.

The coach is teaching him cheek, the usage of chopsticks, the game of chess and table tennis and the methods that allow one to be "smooth". Smooth: the posture of a calm confident attitude that gives the air of knowledge in the face of the absurdity of life. The air of belief in one's mythology that allows one to come across as reliable, attractive and worth listening to.

As I sit in my room this evening, the yellow light illuminating it seems gloomier than usual. The room and how I perceive my life feels suddenly stripped of mythology. I feel the opposite of smooth. A story has been interrupted. The hint of a mythology being laid bare to reveal the absurdity beneath has been sensed. This is perturbing because the possibilities of what i expect to see now are less fixed and more uncertain. These moments of uncertainty and dispossesion of a myth/story/narrative often allow for freedom in perspective and focus on other relatively ignored myths/stories/narratives of one's life. They can also lead to yearning, fear and the desire to return to what is absent - confirming that what is absent is important and therefore making us desire its return even further. Perhaps it will reveal the extent to which what is absent has been imbricated in my life. Perhaps I will remember what it was before the introduction of said myth. A rupture, remembrance, return, contrast might be seen. 

=====================
Should I read wittgenstein contiguously and finish his investigations in one go or should I stretch it over a long period of time? Parts of it are quite dry even if illuminating on the nature of certain kinds of linguistic dogmas.

<b>Some notes on Nausea - sartre</b>
    
"Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.
I leaned back and closed my eyes. But the images, forewarned, immediately leaped up and filled my closed eyes with existences: existence is a fullness which man can never abandon."
-Sartre in nausea

Existence is a fullness which man can never abandon. Except in death? But it means nothing to speak of man after death. "Man after death" is meaningless. It seems like sartre's thought is the antithesis of that of a meditating man. Noteworthy: the dialogue that roquentin has in disgust with the self-taught-man who finds some mystic beauty in "the idea of men" even when each individual man has suffered as a prisoner of war in the box they were locked in. That the box took on some mystic essential quality but each man himself carried lesser meaning. We abstract with words and in doing so become unavoidable essentialists - just like sartre does. IT IS AN ENDEAVOR THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DOOMED TO FAIL. You cannot speak without abstracting some essentialist model can you?  "you", "can", "not", "speak", "without", "abstracting", "some", "essentialist", "model, "can", "you". each word strung together: forming phrases in conjunction - each abstracting some essence for convenience. The specificity chosen through such abstractions in the first place. What does it mean to be radically existentialist? How does one grapple with the absurdity of existence when language does not allow us to do so? It presents itself in this vague sense of strangeness - this alienation - this feeling of nausea that perhaps sartre is trying to get at.

Note: contingency.

On a cloudy chilly saturday afternoon in the balcony as fragile little points of water swirl in the wind before fallingd down on my bare leg as i eat breakfast in the balcony wondering about loss - in particular that of a lover. I have met others since who i've loved and who have loved me back. I'm told that you overcome loss by meeting someone new. But I no longer believe this. You meet someone new - but that brings someone new to you and in only very limited ways 'compensates' for what is lost in the previous person. If the addition of someone new in your life compensates for someone old then perhaps people matter to you only in as much as they fulfill your needs/wants. That perhaps you haven't noticed what makes the person who has left unique, specific and special in their own right independent of what purpose they served to you. Or maybe the ways in which you see their relationship to you are so broad and generic that you failed to notice the pretty little details that set them apart. The inflections in their voice, their perspectives, politics, appearances, the way they sound and look, how they respond to parts of you and what parts of you they bring out.

Each loss is final. When you lose a person, you have lost a whole world that cannot be replaced. Perhaps, this happens every day. The people you are with change and what they were before ceases to exist. I want time to pause so that I can grapple with this frenetic process of loss.

Memory: forgetfulness helps. The presentiments of the present demand presence in it. there's not enough time for remembrance. What was once treasured is constantly being lost to oblivion. I hope I have the good sense to record it in whatever limited capacity /somewhere/. Save it from nothingness so that I may return to it in some feeble capacity for proof that something delightful can be possible.

<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6f4kS2dT_U" target="_blank"> Up in the air - Elvis Depressedly</b></a>

The intoxication of sleep deprivation and a synth curving upward over and over.
Chocolate girl - Spirit they've gone spirit they've vanished. Pretty enchanting fairies in the form of narcissistic dreams. 
It's me? It's me? It's me? The progenitor of my own destruction and melancholy. I demand the right to self destruct in peace. And listen to the chocolate girl at 6:25 AM after a night of sleep deprivation. Bourgeois demands - of luxury. Not of the hardworking socialist man. What is the socialist man? What? what? what? Wy? Leave me alone. Let me listen to the chocolate girl please. Just for now..

we're all (or am I?) convinced we have these pretty and perfectly ineffable souls - with infinite depth and an infallible quality. That is until we're asked to speak about it and confront the mediocrity of the representation. <b>What language do you have to compare the representation with what was attempted to be described?</b>

Melancholia.
Ennui.

Petty discontent.
Aimlessness.

Which is it? which is it?
Neither. It's better to not speak. To avoid the disillusionment with oneself. Let what is felt be felt. Let no injustice be done to it.

As the aurum light of the autumn evening sun of this city filters into my room through pale white venetian blinds, I become acutely conscious of how pretty and idyllic it makes the stillness of my room appear. Yet this moment is situated in a period of distress, hopelessness and uncertainty. All my loved ones are at a distance - each grappling with their own rendition of life's problems with my detached isolated self here in this room. I cannot begin to share this moment or situate it in a meaningful arc of life that goes beyond a cyclical repetition of corporate software engineering and reading at home dealing with the bizarre and confused question of what I want my future to look like and what possibilities haven't suffered foreclosure already. 

See. It began with the appreciation of the evening sun and devolved into the petty little banal complaints of every 20 something alive. My thought is under the totalizing influence of anxiety and despair. Is something new possible? Is something new possible? Is something new possible? Is something new possible? <b>Have I envisaged all realities accessible to me as an adult</b> - reaching the edge of what my body and mind are capable of doing for me? I have time. I have time. I have time. 

See. It began with the appreciation of the evening sun and devolved into the petty little banal complaints of every 20 something alive. The sun is setting. I think I will go to my balcony and look at it, and look at nothing but it. Perhaps in the empty vacuum of my head mesemrized by the bright glow of a lamp in the sky and the cool autumn breeze, I will momentarily forget that a world with meaning beyond pure aesthetics exists. Perhaps I will discover some love. 

The sun has set. The only proof of its existence available to me is how it illuminates the soft cotton candy clouds in hues of pink and yellow near it as they get progressively darker in the distance preparing for night to fall. I don't know about love but a moment of calm was certainly found.

There is.
