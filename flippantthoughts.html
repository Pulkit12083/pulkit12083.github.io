Up in the air - Elvis Depressedly
The intoxication of sleep deprivation and a synth curving upward over and over.
Chocolate girl - Spirit they've gone spirit they've vanished. Pretty enchanting fairies in the form of narcissistic dreams. 
It's me? It's me? It's me? The progenitor of my own destruction and melancholy. I demand the right to self destruct in peace. And listen to the chocolate girl at 6:25 AM after a night of sleep deprivation. Bourgeois demands - of luxury. Not of the hardworking socialist man. What is the socialist man? What? what? what? Wy? Leave me alone. Let me listen to the chocolate girl please. Just for now..

we're all so convinced we have these pretty and perfectly ineffable souls - with infinite depth and an infallible quality. That is until we're asked to speak about it and confront the mediocrity of the representation. What language do you have to compare the representation with what was attempted to be described? 

Melancholia.
Ennui.

Petty discontent.
Aimlessness.

Which is it? which is it?
Neither. It's better to not speak. To avoid the disillusionment with oneself. Let what is felt be felt. Let not injustice be done to it.

As the aurum light of the autumn evening sun of this city filters into my room through pale white venetian blinds, I become acutely conscious of how pretty and idyllic it makes the stillness of my room appear. Yet this moment is situated in a period of distress, hopelessness and uncertainty. All my loved ones are at a distance - each grappling with their own rendition of life's problems with my detached isolated self here in this room. I cannot begin to share this moment or situate it in a meaningful arc of life that goes beyond a cyclical repetition of corporate software engineering and reading at home dealing with the bizarre and confused question of what I want my future to look like and what possibilities haven't suffered foreclosure already. 

See. It began with the appreciation of the evening sun and devolved into the petty little banal complaints of every 20 something alive. My thought is under the totalizing influence of anxiety and despair. Is something new possible? Is something new possible? Is something new possible? Is something new possible? Have I envisaged all realities accessible to me as an adult - reaching the edge of what my body and mind are capable of doing for me? I have time. I have time. I have time. 

See. It began with the appreciation of the evening sun and devolved into the petty little banal complaints of every 20 something alive. The sun is setting. I think I will go to my balcony and look at it, and look at nothing but it. Perhaps in the empty vacuum of my head mesemrized by the bright glow of a lamp in the sky and the cool autumn breeze, I will momentarily forget that a world with meaning beyond pure aesthetics exists. Perhaps I will discover some love. 

The sun has set. The only proof of its existence available to me is how it illuminates the soft cotton candy clouds in hues of pink and yellow near it as they get progressively darker in the distance preparing for night to fall. I don't know about love but a moment of calm was certainly found.

Someone to me on seeing a person fraught with terror and worry about a hypothetical future:
"there is life after crisis"
There is.
Perhaps just one signficantly worth less caring about.

I cannot think yet. The language I have access to is inadequate and reactionary.
Check back in later.
